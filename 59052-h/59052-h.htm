<h3>
CHAPTER I
<br />
AFTER THE QUAT’Z-ARTS BALL
</h3>

<p>
At daybreak, Phil Longwill, the young American
painter, entered his studio, threw away his cigar,
gulped down the contents of his water-jug—and
then slipped into an arm-chair and dozed.
</p>

<p>
What a night!
</p>

<p>
In his half-sleep he thought he was still at the Quat’z-Arts
Ball, from which he had just come; he still heard
the murmuring noise of the multitude, like the prolonged
“moo-o-o” of oxen in the stable; and there still moved
before his eyes the restless throng, masked in the skins
of beasts or trailing gilt-embroidered mantles.
</p>

<p>
His dreaming had the sharp relief of life; but it was
the car on which Helia was drawn—Helia the circus-girl,
the little friend of his boyhood, whom he had not seen
for so long and whom he found here with surprise—it
was this car, with the superb figure of Helia at its summit,
which eclipsed all the rest.
</p>

<p>
The car itself was an attention of Phil’s friends.
They had chosen for its subject the personages of the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_4' name='Page_4' href='#Page_4'>4</a></span>
“Fata Morgana”—a great decorative picture which Phil
was finishing for the Duke of Morgania.
</p>

<p>
Helia, upright at the very summit of the car, like an
idol at the pinnacle of a temple, personified Morgana,
the fairy, the saint, the legendary Queen of the Adriatic.
Lower down, seated at the four corners, Thilda, Marka,
Rhodaïs the slave, and Bertha the Amazon—the four
heroines of Morgania—kept watch and ward over their
queen.
</p>

<p>
The car, drawn by knights, advanced amid hushed
admiration. Helia seemed to float above the sea of
heads, and behind her the great hall was ablaze with
lights.
</p>

<p>
Phil, dozing in his arm-chair, saw himself, clad in his
magnificent Indian costume, marching at the head of
the car, brandishing his tomahawk in honor of Morgana.
Then, at the breaking up of the cortège when the procession
was over, there were the supper-tables taken by
storm amid cries and laughter.
</p>

<p>
And the feast began.
</p>

<p>
Helmets and swords ceased to shine. Hands laid
down battle-axes to wield knives and forks; warriors
fell upon the food as they might have done after a night
of pillage. Each man kissed his fair neighbor. Poufaille,
the sculptor, disguised as the prehistoric man, put
his hairy muzzle against the rosy cheeks of Suzanne, his
model. Close at hand, Phil, the Indian chief, seated at
the table of the Duke of Morgania, talked with Helia of
old times, of the strolling circus in which he had known
her, of their meeting in her dressing-room below the
benches; and he said to her in a low voice:
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_5' name='Page_5' href='#Page_5'>5</a></span>
</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<a name="i-019" id="i-019"></a>
<img src="images/i-019.png" width="356" height="550" alt="" />
<p class="caption">The Concierge</p>
</div>

<p>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_6' name='Page_6' href='#Page_6'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_7' name='Page_7' href='#Page_7'>7</a></span>
</p>

<p>
“Do you remember when I used to go to wait for
you?”
</p>

<p>
“And you,” answered Helia, “the flowers you gave
me—do you remember?”
</p>

<p>
But now it was full day and the sun was lighting up
the studio. Phil’s memories faded little by little, scattered
by the early morning cries of Paris. The shrill
piping of the wandering plumber awakened him with a
start just as he was dropping off into real sleep and
seeing in his dream Helia soar through a strange world
amid heavenly splendors.
</p>

<p>
“Here’s the morning paper, M. Longwill,” said the
old concierge, who came up with the mail; but he stopped
short with open mouth at the sight of Phil’s costume. To
dress one’s self like that! <i>Etait-il Dieu possible!</i> They
didn’t have such ideas in his time!
</p>

<p>
Certainly, Phil was an odd figure in his Indian dress.
If he lowered his head he risked scratching his chin
against the bear’s claws of his collar. He was clad in
leather and glass beads. There were feathers down his
legs and a calumet was stuck in his belt. At his feet
lay the tomahawk which he had brandished a few hours
before in honor of beautiful Helia. He had the look of
a veritable savage. No one would have recognized in him
the society painter, descendant of Philidor de Longueville,
the Protestant banished from France by Louis
XIV, who became a great proprietor in Virginia.
</p>

<p>
“Ah, monsieur,” the concierge began again, “in the
old times when you took walks with Mlle. Helia in my
garden on the roofs of the Louvre, where I was inspector,
you didn’t need to dress up like that to amuse yourself.
Ah, it was the good time then! I remember one day—”
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_8' name='Page_8' href='#Page_8'>8</a></span>
</p>

<p>
“I say, concierge,” interrupted Phil, in a solemn tone;
“go down quick and get me a bottle of seltzer water. I
am dying of thirst!”
</p>

<p>
The concierge disappeared.
</p>

<p>
“Ouf!” Phil gave a sigh of relief. “The old man,
with his good old times, was starting off on his remembrances.
He is in for two hours when he begins with the
Louvre garden. Bah! that’s all fol-de-rol,” he added,
smoothing his hair with his hand, “not to speak of my
having so many things to do this morning. Let’s see:
first, Miss Rowrer; then the duke is to bring Helia. It
appears that Helia has the legendary Morgana type,—so
the duke told me, after seeing her last night,—and, at
the duke’s request, she agrees to pose for my picture.
Oh, I was forgetting! I am expecting Caracal also.”
</p>

<p>
Phil detested Caracal. This critic was his <i>bête noire</i>,
a man sweet and bitter at the same time, who talked of
him behind his back as a painter for pork-packers and
a dauber without talent.
</p>

<p>
Phil had never forgotten his first impression of the
critic. He met him shortly after his arrival in Paris, in
the studio of the sculptor Poufaille, and later on in the
Restaurant de la Mère Michel, and at the Café des Deux
Magots, during his student years. Caracal was outwardly
correct and an intimate friend of the duke, and
he was received at the Rowrers’; and Phil had to be
agreeable to him. Nevertheless, he was going to play
him a trick.
</p>

<p>
As he opened the morning paper, Phil looked around
to assure himself that the pictures in his studio had their
faces turned to the wall, and that his painting of the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_9' name='Page_9' href='#Page_9'>9</a></span>
Fata Morgana was covered with a veil. It was for Caracal’s
benefit that he had made these arrangements the
evening before; and he smiled as he gave a glance at the
portière which separated his studio from a little adjoining
room, where his trick was ready.
</p>

<p>
“Ah, I’m commonplace, am I—no originality? We
shall see!” he said to himself, laughing.
</p>

<p>
“What’s the news?” Phil went on, as he looked absently
through the paper. “‘A Description of the Bal
des Quat’z-Arts.’ Pass!—‘A Case of Treason.’ Pass!—‘War
Declared.’ <i>Diable!</i> ‘The Fleet of the Prince of
Monaco Threatening English Ports.’ Pass!—Good!
Here’s another extract from the ‘Tocsin’: ‘The Tomb
of Richard the Lion-hearted to be Stolen from France!
Interference of Yankee Gold in French Politics,’ signed
‘An Indignant Patriot.’”
</p>

<p>
The foolishness of the article did not prevent Phil’s
reading it to the end.
</p>

<p>
“That’s all very amusing,” he thought; “but why
these personal allusions? What have the Rowrers to do
with it? And who can be writing such nonsense?”
</p>

<p>
Phil turned the page disdainfully, when a sound in
the room made him lift his eyes.
</p>

<p>
Caracal stood before him.
</p>

<p>
Phil had not heard him come in. Caracal entered
without knocking, as the concierge in his hurry had forgotten
to close the door. The critic looked mockingly
at Phil, like those devils who, in German legends, start
up from a hole in the floor and offer you some crooked
bargain in exchange for your soul. He greeted Phil with
an affectation of politeness.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_10' name='Page_10' href='#Page_10'>10</a></span>
</p>

<p>
“How are you, <i>cher ami</i>?”
</p>

<p>
Caracal turned the glitter of his monocle on the Indian
costume.
</p>

<p>
“Very, very curious—very amusing—very American!
From last night’s ball, doubtless?”
</p>

<p>
For once there was nothing to say, and Caracal was
right. It was really very American.
</p>

<p>
Occupied with his paper, Phil had forgotten to change
his costume. He rose, excused himself briefly, and asked
after Caracal’s health.
</p>

<p>
“Thanks, <i>cher ami</i>, I’m very well; allow me to admire
you!”
</p>

<p>
“Wait a bit,” thought Phil to himself. “I’ll give
you something to admire!”
</p>

<p>
But Caracal, with his squirrel-like activity, was already
inspecting the studio and the pictures which were
turned with their faces to the wall.
</p>

<p>
“Oh, ho!” he asked, “so you blush for your work,
<i>mon cher</i>? Yet your talent is very interesting, very
American.”
</p>

<p>
“Don’t let us talk of such trifles,” said Phil; “I show
them only to the ignorant. You’re not really acquainted
with my works, M. Caracal—those which I paint for
myself alone, those into which I put my soul, as your
friend, the painter-philosopher Socrate, used to say. Allow
me to show them to you. Enter, M. Caracal!”
</p>

<p>
Lifting the portière of the little room, Phil showed the
way to Caracal, who stopped on the threshold in amazement.
Phil was fond of practical jokes. With imperturbable
seriousness he had gathered in this room all
the grotesque works which he had found among the art-junk-dealers
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_11' name='Page_11' href='#Page_11'>11</a></span>
in his chance explorations. If he found
a picture cast aside,—provided it was utterly bad,—Phil
bought it. There was one canvas, among the others,
which represented cows—something so fearful that Phil,
the first time he saw it, scarcely knew whether to groan,
or shout with laughter.
</p>

<p>
It was in his concierge’s lodge that Phil one day had
conceived the idea of this collection. The old man of
“my time,” the former inspector of the Louvre roofs,
had on his chimney under bell-glasses two little personages—Monsieur
and Madame—made from lobster-shells;
a claw formed the nose, and the tail was turned into
coat-skirts.
</p>

<p>
“Eureka!” thought Phil, when he saw them. “But
I must have something better still.” And he at once
began a search through the slums of impressionism and
modern style; and he had found what he wanted.
</p>

<p>
“<i>Eh bien</i>, M. Caracal, what do you think of that?”
asked Phil.
</p>

<p>
Caracal, at first upset, pulled himself together.
</p>

<p>
“Bravo, <i>mon cher</i>! you’ve found your line! You are
revealed to yourself! My congratulations, <i>cher ami</i>!”
</p>

<p>
“Does the ignoramus take it seriously?—No; that
would be too funny!” Phil said to himself amazed in
his turn.
</p>

<p>
Phil, with his glass beads jingling at every step, took
the cow painting and set it in full light. The frightful
beasts lowered their crocodile heads to graze in a fantastic
meadow whose daisies resembled white plates with
egg-yolks in the middle.
</p>

<p>
Phil looked at Caracal and winked his eye. Caracal
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_12' name='Page_12' href='#Page_12'>12</a></span>
answered by a prudent shrug. Phil was one of those
rare Americans who can shrug and wink. The mute
dialogue went on:
</p>

<p>
“That catches you, <i>mon vieux</i> Caracal!” said the
wink.
</p>

<p>
“Idiot!” answered the shoulders; “you’ll pay me for
this—to make fun of me—Caracal!”
</p>

<p>
“Each has his turn!” winked Phil.
</p>

<p>
Caracal fixed his eye-glass and stared at the picture.
</p>

<p>
“Very—very interesting—very original. That’s art—that
ought to be at the Luxembourg! Oughtn’t it,
<i>cher ami</i>?”
</p>

<p>
“The deuce!” thought Phil.
</p>

<p>
“And this, look at this!” said Caracal, taking up an
abominable sketch for a pork-butcher’s sign. “Here’s
the quintessence of animalism! Bravo, <i>mon cher</i>, you’re
the man I’m looking for!”
</p>

<p>
“Indeed!” exclaimed Phil, to himself.
</p>

<p>
“Let me explain. I am looking for an artist to illustrate
my new novel.”
</p>

<p>
Phil made a gesture of protest.
</p>

<p>
“No commonplace book,” Caracal went on, “but a
bitter, bleeding slice of life—something which takes you
by the throat, makes you weep and shriek and pant!”
</p>

<p class="caption">The Cow Painting</p>
</div>

<p>
Caracal explained his book. The general idea (an idea
of genius, according to him) was this: A vast house
rises in the midst of Paris, all of glass, transparent from
top to bottom, without curtains. Therein swarm all the
vices; yet there are no crimes, so soft and weak-willed
are the personages, so incapable of anger or hatred. And
they drag themselves from floor to floor, on all-fours like
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_13' name='Page_13' href='#Page_13'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_14' name='Page_14' href='#Page_14'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_15' name='Page_15' href='#Page_15'>15</a></span>
swine. Title, “The House of Glass”—and there you
are!
</p>

<p>
“And you offer me collaboration in such nastiness?”
said Phil.
</p>

<p>
“Do you know what you are saying?” replied Caracal.
</p>

<p>
“It’s my idea of your literature, and I say what I
think.”
</p>

<p>
“Let it be so, <i>mon cher</i>; we’ll say no more about it.
Rather let us look at your beautiful works. That cow
painting is superb! It’s as fine as a Millet. If it’s for
sale, I’ll buy it!”
</p>

<p>
“If you want it, take it. I won’t sell it. I’ll give it
to you.”
</p>

<p>
They came back into the studio. Caracal, well pleased
with the gift, swung his monocle familiarly. Then they
talked of other things, of yesterday’s ball, of the “Tocsin,”
whose sensational head-lines stared at them from
the floor.
</p>

<p>
“What do you think of that?” Phil asked, pointing
to the newspaper.
</p>

<p>
“It’s idiotic, <i>mon cher</i>, utterly idiotic. I don’t know
where Vieillecloche picks up such asinine stuff.”
</p>

<p>
“Who does the articles for him?” demanded Phil.
</p>

<p>
“Who knows?” answered Caracal.
</p>

<p>
With a glance at the clock, Phil excused himself.
</p>

<p>
“Will you permit me? I must get ready—the concierge
is going to do up the studio. Be seated, please;
I’ll be with you again in a moment.”
</p>

<p>
Caracal sat down on a lounge to wait for Phil, who
went to his room to change his Indian costume.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_16' name='Page_16' href='#Page_16'>16</a></span>
</p>

<p>
The concierge returned. He began dusting the studio,
and in his zeal rubbed off half a pastel with his feather
duster. He pulled the veil from sketches, and set the
easels in place. The studio began to be peopled with
half-finished portraits, with designs, with studies of every
kind, representing an immense amount of labor. The
canvas of Morgana, in particular, rid of the cover which
veiled it, illuminated all with a glow of legend. The
figure of the fairy queen was barely indicated; but Helia
was to pose for Phil, as she had promised, and with a
month’s work all would be finished.
</p>

<p>
Caracal, in spite of his jealous ignorance, could not
help admiring the superb production; but he rubbed his
hands as he thought of the picture of the cows which he
was going to carry away with him. He glanced slyly
at Phil, who came back smartly dressed and refreshed
from his bath, fit and full of the joy of life, ready for
work, in spite of his sleepless night.

<h3>
CHAPTER II
<br />
THE FATA MORGANA
</h3>

<p>
Phil prepared his colors. The ball was forgotten,
and the Indian costume was laid away for another
year. Outside, the cries of the plumber and
old-clo’ man alternated, like a trombone after a fife;
and a barrel-organ was grinding below on the sidewalk.
Phil, brushes in hand, spoke now and then a word
with Caracal, lying on the sofa.
</p>

<p>
“Here are my visitors,” said Phil, suddenly.
</p>

<p>
From the stairway came the sound of voices, the light
tread of feet, the swish of skirts.
</p>

<p>
The bell rang.
</p>

<p>
“I was waiting for you, M. le Duc,” said Phil, as he
opened the door. “Come in, I beg of you! Come in,
Mlle. Helia!”
</p>

<p>
“I have brought you Mlle. Helia,” the duke said.
“You know, she consents to pose for you. Look! she’s
not even tired after such a night!”
</p>

<p>
“Oh, as for me, I’m used to it,” said Helia,—“a
little more or a little less!”
</p>

<p>
Caracal came bustling up, shaking hands energetically,
as he always did.
</p>

<p>
“Show the duke your little gallery,” he said in a low
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_18' name='Page_18' href='#Page_18'>18</a></span>
tone to Phil. “You’re too modest—you mustn’t hide
your light under a bushel.”
</p>

<p>
“Pshaw! he wouldn’t appreciate it,” said Phil.
</p>

<p>
They stood before the Morgana painting. Helia,
strongly impressed by the luxury of the studio, looked
around with astonishment. She remembered Phil’s beginnings
in his attic by the quays of the Seine.
</p>

<p>
The duke turned toward him: “Superb! It is very
beautiful! Allow me to congratulate you, Monsieur
Phil!”
</p>

<p>
Phil bowed.
</p>

<p>
Conrad di Tagliaferro, Duke of Morgania, was a <i>grand
seigneur</i>, who left his duchy to take care of itself, and
passed half his time in his Paris mansion. His people
believed him to be quite taken up with politics, discussing
<i>mordicus</i> with the representatives of the Great Powers,
and securing support against the coming storm. For
the duchy was on the banks of the Adriatic, lower than
Montenegro, and backed up against Albania, where the
clouds threatened. The duke, meanwhile, went about
with Caracal, his professor of elegant vice, and his handsome
presence was a part of <i>Tout-Paris</i>.
</p>

<p>
“Your picture is a masterpiece, Monsieur Phil,” the
duke went on. “It would be impossible to interpret
better the legend of my ancestress, Morgana. It will
hang well in the great hall of the castle, above the ducal
throne—I see it from here. You have quite caught what
I wished, and I am grateful to you.”
</p>

<p>
The great painting took up a whole side of the studio,
and its effect was superb under the light, which fell in
floods. It was a decorative work, which, from the first,
impressed the beholder by its look of strangeness.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_19' name='Page_19' href='#Page_19'>19</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Phil was familiar with the mirage which is peculiar to
the Adriatic Sea, and which is known as the Fata Morgana.
</p>

<p>
In the morning oftenest, but sometimes at evening,
you suddenly perceive in the sky images of various
things—of ruined towers and castles, which crumble and
change and take on prodigious shapes. The dwellers of
the coast call the phenomenon the Fata Morgana; their
superstitious ideas lead them to see in it the enchantments
of a fairy (<i>fata</i>), whereas it is simply an effect of
the mirage caused by the heating of the sea. This was
the moment which Phil had chosen for his picture.
</p>

<p>
The lower part of the canvas was in shadow, but the
upper part was resplendent with light; and towers
seemed to rise and arches hang above the abyss, while
visions appeared between the clouds. The setting sun
lighted up with its dying fires the moving mists, whereon
rainbow tints were playing. At the horizon the sea mingled
with the clouds. Morgana rose from the waves
which broke along the beach. Strange sea-flowers clung
to her hair and covered her shoulders. In the background,
cliffs fell straight down to the sea; and all along
the shore an ecstatic people acclaimed the return of their
lady, the Duchess Morgana.
</p>

<p>
Phil had put all his talent into this picture. Months
of implacable labor were in it. The duke, who had not
yet seen the finished canvas, seemed delighted. Phil was
paid for his labors.
</p>

<p>
The Duke of Morgania had a love for art and artists.
He chatted in a friendly way with Phil of the numerous
studies which such a picture demands.
</p>

<p>
“I should have liked to be a painter,” he said, smilingly.
“I am infatuated with the bohemian life!”
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_20' name='Page_20' href='#Page_20'>20</a></span>
</p>

<p>
“It hasn’t been all amusement to me,” replied Phil.
“Art is not easy, <i>allez</i>!”
</p>

<p>
“It’s about the same in everything; nothing is easy,”
Helia observed.
</p>

<p>
She entered into the conversation timidly. Accustomed
as she had been from childhood to brave a thousand
eyes in the circus ring, Helia felt herself embarrassed
in the sumptuous studio where she found
Phil, friend of her childhood and youth—Phil, who had
been so fond of her then, and who doubtless loved her
still. She would know soon,—when they were alone,—if
only by the way in which he would take her hand.
</p>

<p>
“It is the same in everything. You are right, mademoiselle,”
the duke answered. “Yours is an art also.”
</p>

<p>
Helia blushed with pleasure.
</p>

<p>
“Phil will be proud of me,” she thought.
</p>

<p>
“But she’s taking it seriously, the little mountebank,”
Caracal murmured to himself. “She is as big
a fool as Phil, on my word!”

<p>
“<i>Mon cher ami</i>,” the duke said to Phil, “Mlle. Helia
has a singular resemblance to Morgana. For we have
documents concerning the appearance of Morgana—Sansovino’s
statue at Ancona, for example, the Botticelli
of the Louvre, and the stained-glass window of the
throne-room in the ducal castle, as well as numberless
pictures scattered through the cottages of Morgania.
There is an admitted classic type. You will only have
to finish the figure of my ancestress with Mlle. Helia,
and your picture will be perfect.”
</p>

<p>
“And what happiness for me!” said Helia. “Phil—Monsieur
Phil will do my portrait!”

</p>

<p>
But Phil interrupted Helia to keep the duke, who was
on the point of departing:
</p>

<p>
“Wait a moment; Miss Ethel Rowrer is coming to
see the picture. She is over there in the students’ atelier.
I’ll go and tell her.”
</p>

<p>
Phil went out; doors were heard opening and closing;
and then he came back with Miss Rowrer, whom he had
found just quitting her work. She was fastening a
bouquet of Parma violets at her waist, and was ready
to come.
</p>

<p>
Miss Rowrer entered.
</p>

<p>
She was tall and pink and blonde. She had distinguished
features, with a wilful forehead and solid chin.
Her beauty and her practice of outdoor sports gave her
a self-confidence which was superb, while the prestige of
the name of her father—the famous Chicagoan—and his
colossal fortune were as nothing when she looked you in
the face with her clear eyes, lighted up with intelligence.
As soon as she entered the studio there seemed to be no
one else there.
</p>

<p>
Miss Rowrer nodded familiarly to Caracal and the
duke, habitués of the Comtesse de Donjeon’s teas,
where she had made their acquaintance, as well as that
of Phil, some months previously. She cast a discreet
glance at Helia. As for Phil, whose pupil she was
and whose talent she admired, she treated him as a
friend.
</p>

<p>
They began talking immediately. Miss Rowrer spoke
of her brother Will, of his yacht, still in the dock at
Boston, but which was soon to sail for France; of his
autumn cruise in the Mediterranean; then, changing
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_24' name='Page_24' href='#Page_24'>24</a></span>
the subject, she talked of art and literature, lightly, without
pose.
</p>

<p>
“How can any one find time,” thought Helia, “to
learn so many pretty things!”
</p>

<p>
“Is that your Morgana picture?” Miss Rowrer asked
Phil, pointing to the great canvas. “That half-painted
figure will doubtless be Morgana herself—it is very
beautiful. But,” she added, as she turned to the duke,
“explain it to me a little, will you? I am not acquainted
with the subject.”
</p>

<p>
“What, Miss Rowrer! You know everything, and you
don’t know the legend of Morgana!”
</p>

<p>
“Only by name,” said Miss Rowrer. “In my picture-books
there used to be Bluebeard and ogres and ugly
wolves, who made me afraid—and the good fairies Mélusine
and Morgana, who delighted me. They did so much
good with their magic wands!”
</p>

<p>
“Morgana is my ancestress,” said the duke. “She is
my good genius. There is not a cottage in Morgania
where her picture does not hang, next to the icons of the
Virgin. In the winter evenings, around the fire, they
recount her exploits and those of Rhodaïs and Bertha.
Children grow up with it in their blood; they no more
think of their country without its heroines than without
its woods and mountains.”
</p>

<p>
“And what particular event have you chosen for this
picture?” asked Miss Rowrer. “Is it the coming of
Morgana?”
</p>

<p>
“By the sea she departed,” said the duke, “and she
has never come back. Yet she will come, they say.”
</p>

<p>
“You laugh at it?”
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_25' name='Page_25' href='#Page_25'>25</a></span>
</p>

<p>
“Not at all,” answered the duke. “Such things seen
in the light of Paris appear altogether ridiculous; but
away in Morgania there are thousands of good people—or
thousands of foolish people, if you wish—” the duke
corrected himself, in terror of the mocking smile of
Caracal, his professor of skepticism—“thousands of
foolish people who talk of nothing else and await her
return.”
</p>

<p>
“But when did she go away?” asked Miss Rowrer.
</p>

<p>
“Oh, ah!—well—a thousand years ago,” answered the
duke.
</p>

<p>
“A thousand years ago!” exclaimed Miss Rowrer,
amused by these stories of fairy duchesses and poor
mountaineers sitting by the sea and watching from
father to son for Morgana. “But who has foretold her
return?” she asked.
</p>

<p>
“An old sorceress who lives like an owl in the hollow
of a rock.”
</p>

<p>
“Really!”
</p>

<p>
“Truly and really! People come to consult her from
every quarter. She makes her fire on three red stones,
observes the sky and the stars, traces serpents on the
sand—and then this old woman foretells the future.
Now, according to her prediction, the cycle of time has
swung round and Morgana is coming, bringing in her
arms the fortune of Morgania. Events, we must acknowledge,
seem to bear out the sorceress: the country
is deeply troubled; I shall soon be obliged to go back
myself—and you can imagine whether it is amusing for
me? Oh, I wish I were a simple citizen of Paris!”
</p>

<p>
“<i>Eh bien, monseigneur!</i>” said Miss Rowrer, “in that
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_26' name='Page_26' href='#Page_26'>26</a></span>
case, abdicate, abdicate. But first tell me, I beg of you,
the legend of Morgana.”
</p>

<p>
“It does not date from yesterday, as I have told
you,” the duke went on. “The duchy was already in
existence, having been given to Hugh, chief of the
Franks, by the Emperor Theodosius; but it was only in
Morgana’s time that it came to a consciousness of itself.
Morgana was a poor sailor-girl, according to some—a
king’s daughter, according to others. Did she ever really
exist? or is she only an ideal figure created by a people
in infancy, more inclined to poetry than to reflection,
and personifying in her all its great heroines?
</p>

<p>
“However that may be, the year, as your Edgar Poe
says, ‘had been a year of terrors.’ There was fighting
along the frontiers. The duke, selfish-hearted and weak,
had lost two of his provinces. The people were in
despair. Morgana brought hope back to them. Her
piety and her beauty worked miracles. A light, it is
said, followed her. She took up arms for her country
and worked wonders. The hordes of the enemy thought
her invulnerable—they had set a price on her head. One
day, in battle, she saved Duke Adhemar, when he was at
the point of being massacred; she leaped forward, with
the great white-cross standard in one hand and her battle-ax
in the other, slashed her way through the barbarians,
and, her arms red with blood, brought back the duke
amid the acclamations of the people. Their enthusiasm
was immense; they prayed at Morgana’s feet. ‘What
passed afterward?’ Had the duke promised marriage
to her, as some pretend—and, to obtain peace, did he sell
Morgana to the enemy? Our chronicles are uncertain
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_27' name='Page_27' href='#Page_27'>27</a></span>
on that point. But Duke Adhemar compromised himself
by some ugly deed or other—the perjury of a coward.
One evening the indignant Morgana came down to the
shore, followed by a whole people, who demanded her for
their duchess and scattered flowers before her. But she
entered her bark alone. ‘Since the duke has sworn,’
she said, ‘let me save his honor. I go. May my sacrifice
redeem his race! And remember—not gold, but youth
and courage are a people’s strength!’ Then Morgana
sailed away from the shore and disappeared in the open
sea, while the crowd still prayed for her. The next day
a strange mirage lighted up the country, and the people
said: ‘It is the soul of Morgana, virgin and martyr.’
Then the people, in their indignation, drove Duke Adhemar
from the throne. They raised altars to her. To
Morgana was given the title of duchess; she became the
protectress of Morgania—and of my house, whose honor
she had saved.”
</p>

<p>
“Let us hope she will come back,” said Miss Rowrer.
“You are quite right to believe in her!”
</p>

<p>
“I—” began the duke.
</p>

<p>
“Why, yes, monseigneur,” continued Miss Rowrer,
who had remarked the duke’s accent of conviction toward
the end of his story. “Don’t deny it—it is beautiful to
believe in something! M. Caracal will pardon you this
time.”
</p>

<p>
“Willingly, Miss Rowrer,” said Caracal, with the
pinching of the lips which was his mode of smiling.
“Willingly; but on one condition. Get Monsieur Phil to
show you his works.”
</p>

<p>
“Here they are, it seems to me,” Ethel said,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_28' name='Page_28' href='#Page_28'>28</a></span>
pointing to the paintings and sketches which filled the
studio.
</p>

<p>
“No doubt,” Caracal insisted; “but—all his handiwork
is not here. Come, Monsieur Phil, show us the
work which is really yours—what you paint with your
soul! Don’t be so modest; bring the light from beneath
the bushel!”
</p>

<p>
“Yes; show us, Phil,” said the duke.
</p>

<p>
“Monseigneur—” Phil began.
</p>

<p>
Caracal shot a triumphant glance at Phil.
</p>

<p>
“You will allow me, <i>cher ami</i>?”—and he opened the
little gallery to Miss Rowrer and the duke, while Helia,
seated in the shadow, waited impatiently for the visitors
to leave.
</p>

<p>
Gay laughter was heard. Miss Ethel and the duke
came back. “Ah, charming! Couldn’t be more amusing,”
said the duke. “A regular art-trap! I must get
one myself, to catch fools.”
</p>

<p>
All left the studio except Phil, and Helia, who was
to pose for him. They were already on the stairs, and
Caracal, exasperated, went with them, like the legendary
devil who disappears into the earth, carrying with him,
instead of a soul, his cow painting under his arm. Behind
him, in place of the classical odor of brimstone,
there was only the fragrance of the Parma violets which
Miss Rowrer let fall by accident as she went away.
</p>

<p>
The noise ceased on the staircase—Phil was already
seated on the sofa beside Helia.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_29' name='Page_29' href='#Page_29'>29</a></span>

<div class="chapter">

<h3>
CHAPTER III
<br />
REMEMBERING THE GOLDEN DAYS
</h3>

<p>
They looked at each other as if astonished to be
once again together. Helia admired Phil, whom
she found handsomer and stronger—more, indeed,
of a man. Phil scanned the refined features of Helia:
she seemed even more beautiful than in the old days.
</p>

<p>
Seated thus, hand in hand, eyes gazing into eyes,
everything came back to memory: their first meeting in
the little provincial town where Phil was studying, and
where the circus in which Helia appeared had been set
up; their simple, childish love, the pretty romance of
their youth.
</p>

<p>
In the old days Phil used to speak to her with the
familiar “thou”; here, in the quiet of the studio, alone
with this beautiful young girl, it seemed too familiar,
almost wanting in respect for her.
</p>

<p>
“Perhaps Phil is more intimidated than myself,”
Helia thought in her surprise. “He has not even kissed
me. But whether he speaks to me with a ‘thou’ or a
‘you’ matters little, provided he loves me still!”
</p>

<p>
“Now, then, Phil,” she asked, between her smiles,
“what hast thou—what have you been doing all this
time?”
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_30' name='Page_30' href='#Page_30'>30</a></span>
</p>

<p>
“Oh!” answered Phil, “many things! And you,
Helia?”
</p>

<p>
“Oh, for me it has been always the same thing, always
just as it was before—do you remember?”
</p>

<p>
Ah, the childish doings of other days! How happy
Helia was to take shelter in their sweet memories!
</p>

<p>
“Do you remember,” said Phil, “the day I saw you
first? You know it was at the Fête-Dieu procession.
How pretty you were as the little Saint John!”
</p>

<p>
On that day houses are decorated; the walls are hung
with white sheets, on which are pinned flowers and
greenery, and the procession passes between these blossoming
walls. But the one thing in the procession for
Phil had been the little Saint John.
</p>

<p>
It was Helia who took the rôle. At first they had
chosen the daughter of a rich merchant; but fear of
drafts and a possible fall of rain—a cold is caught so
quickly—led them to change at the last moment; and in
haste they took a creature of less importance, whose
colds did not count.
</p>

<p>
“I remember,” said Helia, “they came to get me at
the circus. I happened to be in a pink <i>maillot</i>, and they
put the sheepskin on my back and the wooden cross in
my hand—and ten francs in papa’s hand—and so I
became the little Saint John.”
</p>

<p>
“And what a delightful Saint John you were!” said
Phil. “I became a lover and a poet on the spot; I wrote
verses—I was wild!”
</p>

<p>
“And you got wilder still,” said Helia, “when you
found out that, instead of a merchant’s daughter, I was
the famous Helia—the acrobatic star whom the posters
pictured on her trapeze, amid stars and suns!”
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_31' name='Page_31' href='#Page_31'>31</a></span>
</p>

</p>

<p>
Helia, in her turn, had seen Phil a few days later,
while she was playing Wolf and Sheep. Sinking back
in the sofa-cushions of the great studio, she chatted with
Phil of that momentous event.
</p>

<p>
“That was the day after they had thrown so many
oranges to me—do you remember, Phil?—and I was
playing Wolf in the square with the neighbors’ children.
You remember the game? One of the players is the wolf,
another is the shepherd, the others are the sheep. They
stand behind the shepherd and walk around singing:
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="o1">‘Promenons-nous dans les bois</p>
<p>Pendant que le loup n’y est pas!’</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="o2">(‘Let’s go walking through the woods,</p>
<p>While the wolf’s away!’)</p>
</div></div></div>

<p class="post">
And then the wolf jumps out and tries to catch a
sheep.”
</p>

<p>
That second meeting of Phil and Helia had passed
off very prettily. Helia was a regular little tomboy at
play. Of course she did not often get a chance to
play, and she found it pleasant to leap and laugh with
other children; and Phil was there, standing around
with the boys. He would have given everything in the
world to be wolf and seize Helia and devour her with
kisses—if he had dared.
</p>

<p>
And perhaps he might have dared,—lured on by a
smile from the little Saint John,—but some one (it was
Cemetery, the clown) came out from the circus-tent, and
at sight of him sheep and shepherd scattered. He called
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_34' name='Page_34' href='#Page_34'>34</a></span>
harshly to Helia, and with a gesture sent her into the
tent.
</p>

<p>
The little girl obeyed without a word, raising her elbow
as she passed before her master, as if to ward off a
blow. The last thing seen by Phil was the appealing
glance of Helia, which seemed to say to him, “You see—and
yet I was doing no harm—and we’d have had
such fun!”
</p>

<p>
That was their second meeting.
</p>

<p>
The next day Phil prowled around the circus-tent with
the other boys and tried to catch a glimpse of Helia
through the holes of the canvas, or from beneath,
stretched out flat on the ground.
</p>

<p>
All the day long the little girl was kept rehearsing her
exercises. Sometimes it was the trapeze, or again the carpet.
Cemetery gave her his directions with a serious air.
</p>

<p>
“<i>Allez!</i>—firm on your feet—smile, smile—throw your
head back—don’t move your feet! Bend back! bend!
bend! Fall on your hands! There—there—smile!
<i>Tonnerre!</i> Won’t you smile?”
</p>

<p>
But Phil waited in vain; he never saw her play again
with the others.
</p>

<p>
Soon afterward the circus went away, and Phil, when
vacation-time came, returned to America. He took with
him tender remembrances, seeing often the last touching
glance of Helia with her beautiful sad eyes. Pity mingled
with his tenderness.
</p>

<p class="caption">Helia and her “Professor”</p>
</div>

<p>
Phil went on his way through Paris and London and
across the ocean to New York, and then on to the sunny
South and his old ancestral mansion on the Chesapeake.
But nothing, neither terrapin-catching nor duck-shooting
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_35' name='Page_35' href='#Page_35'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_36' name='Page_36' href='#Page_36'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_37' name='Page_37' href='#Page_37'>37</a></span>
nor horseback-riding through the country, could efface
his childhood’s first love, which only grew in solitude.
How he regretted that he had not taken part in the game
when the little Helia invited him with a smile—that he
had not kissed her through her brown curls!
</p>

<p>
Phil came back to France to go on with his studies.
Helia was already a grown girl when he saw her again.
The circus was being advertised, and great posters with
the name of Helia placarded the walls.
</p>

<p>
With what impatience Phil awaited her! He was to
see her again. He passed hours in the open square
where the circus was being set up in the disorder of
wagons and poles and canvas, peering anxiously into the
circus-wagons.
</p>

<p>
The circus was in a single tent. The artistes for
changing their costumes had rude dressing-rooms amid
the confusion of circus properties underneath the
benches on which the public sat.
</p>

<p>
One evening Helia had finished dressing by the light
of a candle when she heard a noise above her head. She
saw the bunting beneath the benches lifted, and a little
bunch of flowers fell on her shoulder. She nearly cried
out with surprise. During her turn they often threw
oranges and flowers to her—that was commonplace; but
these flowers!
</p>

<p>
As soon as she came into the ring she looked at the
benches above her dressing-room. She fancied she recognized
there the one whom she had seen when she was
playing Wolf—how long ago!
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">

</div></div>
<p>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_38' name='Page_38' href='#Page_38'>38</a></span>
</p>

<p>
(Phil took his banjo from the wall behind the sofa.
In a low voice he murmured the old song, which he had
not forgotten, to the air played by the band when it
announced Helia’s entrance into the ring:
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="o1">“Le Roy fait battre le tambour</p>
<p>Pour appeler ses dames,...</p>

<p>Lui a ravi son âme.”</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="o2">(“The King has the drum beat</p>
<p>To call out his ladies,...</p>
<p>And the first one he sees</p>
<p>Steals away his soul.”)</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>
All the memories of the past rose up in Helia at the
familiar air.)
</p>

<p class="p2">
At that time she was living inside a courtyard where
the circus people put up their wagons. There was a
stable for the horses and an inn for the men. Through
the great gate of the courtyard the circus was in full
sight, out in the public square.
</p>

<p>
One evening it was raining. Helia was at the gate
and, caught by the rain, hesitated to go on. All at once
Phil came up. She recognized him, and both were so
moved that they said only the simplest things to each
other.
</p>

<p>
“Thanks for your bouquet,” said Helia.
</p>

<p>
“Mademoiselle,” Phil began.
</p>

<p>
“I remember you very well,” Helia went on; “I knew
you a long time ago. Why did you not play Wolf with
us?”
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_39' name='Page_39' href='#Page_39'>39</a></span>
</p>

<p>
“Because that man made you go in,” Phil answered.
</p>

<p>
“Ah, yes! true,” said Helia.
</p>

<p>
Phil feared she would hear the beating of his heart.
He tried to put an end to their embarrassment, so he
chattered about the rain and the bad weather.
</p>

<p>
“Mademoiselle, you must forgive me—I have no umbrella!”
he said.
</p>

<p>
“That’s no matter,” said Helia. “Accompany me
to the circus. Wait a bit—here’s what we want!”
</p>

<p>
On the wall beside them there hung a circus-poster.
She took it, lifted it with one hand above her head, while
Phil held the other end; and the two under one shelter
crossed the square.
</p>

<p>
“Shall I see you again, mademoiselle?” Phil asked,
when they had reached the circus.
</p>

<p>
“Surely—in the courtyard yonder by the wagons—or
here in the evening.”
</p>

<p>
Phil left her without speaking further. Soon, through
the canvas, he heard the air that announced her turn:
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="o1">“Marquis, t’es bien plus heureux que moi</p>
<p class="i1">D’avoir femme si belle;</p>
<p>Si tu voulais me l’accorder</p>
<p class="i1">Je me chargerai d’elle!”</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="o2">(“Marquis, you’re happier than I</p>
<p class="i1">Because your wife’s so pretty;</p>
<p>If you’ll give her up to me,</p>
<p class="i1">Willingly’ll take her!”)</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>
The days that followed were for Helia the sunny corner
of her sad childhood. When she saw Phil she was
happy—and she saw him every day! The very difficulty
of meeting added charm to the adventure.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_40' name='Page_40' href='#Page_40'>40</a></span>
</p>

<p>
They saw each other in the courtyard of the inn.
</p>

<p>
Helia had the care of many things. A baby—Sœurette
(Little Sister), held on to her skirts, and Helia gave a
mother’s care to the child. She busied herself also with
the linen drying on the clothes-lines; she scattered grain
before the chickens which were tied by their legs; she
sewed at her bodices or at her little performance-slippers;
or else she would be coming back from market
with a great loaf of bread under her arm and provisions
in her basket. Always she was charming. Her least
movement was full of grace.
</p>

<p>
When Phil could not speak with Helia he would press
her hand as he passed. Then he would watch her from
afar. Unconsciously they fell greatly in love with each
other—he because he found her so pathetic, she because
he was so timid and so handsome. From a few words
picked up here and there, and from a talk with the clown
at a café, Phil had come to know something of Helia’s
story—for she never spoke of it herself, through pride.
Or was it a woman’s shame in her desire to show to the
one she loved only what was fair? Yet she had nothing
to conceal,—pretty, sweet, valiant Helia!
</p>

<p>
Her story?
</p>

<p>
Helia was her circus name. Her real name Phil did
not learn. She was not the daughter of Cemetery the
clown, although she called herself so; she was only his
trained pupil.
</p>

<p>
Her father was a gentleman of Arles who became a
widower with two daughters on his hands,—Helia and
Sœurette,—one much older than the other. He fell in
love with a circus-rider, and a terrible life began for
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_41' name='Page_41' href='#Page_41'>41</a></span>
him, with tours across Europe, and marriage with the
woman, who ruled him with a rod of iron. The little
daughters went with him, for he had no family other
than relatives far removed. Then ruin came. A circus
whose director and backer he had become, and into which
he had put all his money, failed. He died, abandoned
by every one, and leaving his two little girls to the care
of Cemetery, who had been his circus-manager. Cemetery,
harsh and honest, adopted the children and determined
to make artistes of them. He at once began the
training of the elder, and Helia grew up under him for
master. “You shall do it or die!” Cemetery used to
say when teaching her to perform. To those who represented
to him that the profession was already encumbered,
he answered: “There is always room on top!
Beauty is well—talent is better. To work!”
</p>

<p>
Such was the story of Helia.
</p>

<p>
When Phil asked her about it, Helia did not answer,
but only smiled faintly.
</p>

<p>
But Phil knew that she was unhappy, and his love
for her went on growing. He dreamed a thousand chivalrous
schemes—each madder than the one before. He
felt within him the passion and daring resolution of the
Longuevilles, his ancestors. He had also inherited their
zeal for virtue. He would tear Helia away from her
rough life. He would educate her—he would make her
fit to be his companion. He explained his ideas to Helia.
At first they amused her, but when she saw how sincere
he was, she ended by believing them.
</p>

<p>
Helia went out rarely—scarcely more than from the
inn to the circus. She would have liked to meet Phil
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_42' name='Page_42' href='#Page_42'>42</a></span>
oftener. When evening came, in her dressing-room
under the benches, she donned her costume quickly and
received her friend. It was easy for him to enter
without being remarked. On the outside there were
wagons which left only a narrow passage. It was where
the canvas of the circus-tent joined; he had only to pull
it aside to enter. Then he was at once in the dressing-room
inclosed by boards and fragments of carpets worn
out by generations of tumblers.
</p>

<p>
Phil would sit on a trunk while Helia combed her
beautiful hair in front of a broken mirror. It never
came to their minds that there could be anything wrong
in what they were doing. They had long talks. Helia
spoke of her profession and described her exercises.
</p>

<p>
“I am going to do the high leap. I spring and catch
the bar—I get my balance, standing on my hands—and
then I go off with a somersault! The high leap, Phil,
you could learn in a month—you who are afraid of
nothing!”
</p>

<p>
Phil would listen, and then interrupt her gently and
speak of all sorts of things, opening new horizons before
her; and Helia was happy and glad to learn.
</p>

<p>
“What beautiful arms!” said Phil one evening, as she
was soaping them in a basin of cold water.
</p>

<p>
“And I take care of them!” answered Helia, “<i>songe
donc</i>, Phil! (They were already using the familiar
French “thou” to each other.) Just think; every evening
I owe my life to these arms! When I do the flying
trapeze they mustn’t miss their hold. I should be
crushed on the benches,—think of it!—and I have to
smile all the same.”

<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_45' name='Page_45' href='#Page_45'>45</a></span>
</p>

<p>
As she dried her arms, Phil raised his eyes and saw,
near the shoulder, a brown stain on the white skin.
</p>

<p>
“That’s nothing,” said Helia; “I knocked against
a post.”
</p>

<p>
Phil looked at her closely.
</p>

<p>
“You’ve been crying again to-day! But I—I’m
not afraid of Cemetery,” he went on. “I’ll go for him
to-morrow and punch his face. I won’t have him touching
you any more. First of all, he hasn’t the right! and
I’ll forbid him.”
</p>

<p>
But Helia shook her head: “No!” She added: “I’ll
attend to that! I belong to you now—not to him!
There he comes,” she said suddenly. “Go away—and
not a word, whatever happens!”
</p>

<p>
Above the noise of the band and of the public, Helia
had heard Cemetery’s voice. Phil had just time to get
away.
</p>

<p>
“Are you going to come when you are called?” the
man said.
</p>

<p>
At a glance, from Helia’s emotion, from certain noises
he had heard, he guessed the truth. But he was far
from thinking of Phil. He suspected that some circus
man was paying court to her.
</p>

<p>
Phil, from the outside, heard this dialogue.
</p>

<p>
“You were not alone?”
</p>

<p>
“No!”
</p>

<p>
“There was a man here?”
</p>

<p>
Helia did not answer.
</p>

<p>
“Wait a bit,” said Cemetery. “I’ll teach you—”
</p>

<p>
“Don’t touch me—I forbid you!”
</p>

<p>
Phil looked through a rent in the canvas.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_46' name='Page_46' href='#Page_46'>46</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Helia stood transfigured, superb with energy. She
was no longer a child driven by cuffs and blows; she
was the young woman awakened by love, conscious of
her rights and her duties. Phil’s soul was in her. Helia
spoke in a low tone, and her attitude was so calm that
the man stopped in amazement.
</p>

<p>
“<i>Hein!</i> what is it?” he stammered.
</p>

<p>
“Leave this room!” said Helia, “or I will have the
police arrest you. You have no right over me! From
to-day you shall keep your hands off me! Leave the
room,” she repeated.
</p>

<p>
As if her gesture had the power of a charm, the man
went out, dumb with surprise and raising his elbow as
if to protect himself.
</p>

<p>
Phil was filled with enthusiasm at the sight of Helia’s
self-deliverance. His counsels had fallen on good
ground. He had awakened in Helia a spirit of independence,
and this made him feel an increase of responsibility.
</p>

<p>
At midnight, while the artistes were supping at the
inn, Phil saw Helia in the shadow of the wagons. It
was there that he met her henceforth, for after this he
went no more to the dressing-room. Their conversations
took place in the peace of night; they said a thousand
things to each other, talking, like children, of whatever
passed through their heads, drifting with the current
which bore both onward.
</p>

<p>
“I don’t like the career they have chosen for me,”
said Phil! “they want me to be a diplomat. Later on
I wish to be an artist—a painter or sculptor; a painter,
I think. My guardian will never be willing. But never
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_47' name='Page_47' href='#Page_47'>47</a></span>
mind! I will go to Paris—I will make my way by
myself!”
</p>

<p>
“Who knows if I shall ever see you again!” said
Helia. “What will become of me?”
</p>

<p>
“Helia, you shall come to me as soon as I have earned
money.”
</p>

<p>
“Paris,” said Helia, dreamily. “You will be all alone
there when you arrive. Ah! if I only knew some one!
At any rate, I will give you the address of a hotel for
artistes where I have been myself with Cemetery, and a
letter for Suzanne, whom I knew at school. Suzanne
is an actress. We write to each other sometimes.”
</p>

<p>
Ah, what adieus were theirs the evening before the
separation! How Helia trembled when Phil kissed her—and
what promises he made her!
</p>

<p class="p2">
Sinking back in the sofa-cushions, Helia and Phil stared
vaguely before them at the Morgana picture. The perfume
of Miss Rowrer’s violets reached them, light and
subtle; and the minutes passed in silence. Then Phil
sang in an undertone:
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="o1">“Adieu, ma mie, adieu, mon cœur,</p>
<p class="i1">Adieu, mon espérance!...</p>
<p>Puisque il me faut servir le roi,</p>
<p class="i1">Séparons-nous d’ensemble.”</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="o2">(“Farewell, my love, farewell, my heart,</p>
<p class="i1">Farewell, all my hope!...</p>
<p>And since I must serve my king,</p>
<p class="i1">We must separate from each other!”)</p>
</div></div></div>

<p class="post">
He put aside the banjo and began talking with Helia,
asking questions about her present life.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_48' name='Page_48' href='#Page_48'>48</a></span>
</p>

<p>
“How long have you been in Paris, Helia? A short
time only?”
</p>

<p>
Helia, who was astonished, was on the point of replying:
“Why, I wrote you.” She remained silent, however.
The sumptuous studio—the visits of monseigneurs
and beautiful young ladies—how different it was
from the Phil of other days, the Phil of the circus, the
student who had been devoted to her later on in Paris!
Why not a word of their life then, of their idyl of the
Louvre roof-garden? etc.... He did not even speak of
all that; his remembrance seemed to be at an end. This,
then, was all he found to say to her after more than a
year of separation—he who could not live without her,
who had said it a hundred times.
</p>

<p>
“Where are you living?” asked Phil. “At the Hôtel
des Artistes, where I went when I came to Paris? I
left it on the advice of Suzanne, your great actress,”
Phil went on, smilingly.
</p>

<p>
“Ah, Phil! I thought her a great actress,” said
Helia. “She was the only person I knew in Paris. Oh,
if I could have been more useful to you, I would have
been! No,” she began again, quickly, “I am not living
there; but I keep Cemetery there.”
</p>

<p>
“Cemetery!” replied Phil.
</p>

<p>
“The poor fellow has grown old—he is out of work;
I pay for his room until he can find an engagement.”
</p>

<p>
“What, Cemetery, that brute?”
</p>

<p>
“He made me an artiste!” Helia replied, bravely.
</p>

<p>
“And your little sister?” continued Phil,—“Sœurette,
you called her—what has become of her? Do you
keep her with you?”
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_49' name='Page_49' href='#Page_49'>49</a></span>
</p>

<p>
“Yes,” said Helia. “My father’s family claimed her,
but it was a little late, was it not? I have kept her,
thanks to several friends—M. Socrate, the poet, among
the rest.”
</p>

<p>
“Socrate!” said Phil. “I know a person of that
name. It can’t be the same—mine is a painter.”
</p>

<p>
“So is mine.”
</p>

<p>
“He is a sculptor also,” added Phil.
</p>

<p>
“It must be the same man,” said Helia.
</p>

<p>
“Impossible!” thought Phil. “Socrate a friend of
Helia! How can they have met?”
</p>

<p>
Phil thought of the life of Helia in circuses and
music-halls—the coarse environment where art touches
elbows with shamelessness. “What influences have been
around her,” he thought in sadness, “during all this
time in which I have not seen her?”
</p>

<p>
“Socrate does many kind little things for me,” Helia
went on. “He posts my letters and makes himself
useful. He’s a man who will be celebrated some day;
oh, you will see!”
</p>

<p>
So spoke Helia, in the spirit of loyalty. In reality
she cared little enough for Socrate; but it pleased her
to let Phil think that she cared for him. So much the
worse if Phil should be vexed! Had <i>he</i> been afraid to
give pain? Since she has been in the studio he has not
once kissed her!
</p>

<p>
Helia rose to go away.
</p>

<p>
“Then it’s for to-morrow, Phil?”
</p>

<p>
Phil begged her to stay.
</p>

<p>
“No; I will come back,” said Helia, “and we’ll pose
to-morrow. I have so many things to do to-day—my
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_50' name='Page_50' href='#Page_50'>50</a></span>
costumer, my director, a new apparatus to try—I must
hurry.”
</p>

<p>
“Phil has forgotten me,” said Helia to herself. “It
had to come—I am nothing to him now!”
</p>

<p>
As she passed out of the door she was aware of the
perfume of the violets which Miss Rowrer had let fall.

<h3>
CHAPTER IV
<br />
WHEN PHIL CAME TO PARIS
</h3>

<p>
As Helia felt, Phil was, indeed, no longer the same.
This was no more the Phil who had loved her in
the old days.
</p>

<p>
When the Phil who did not go into “society,” and
knew neither duke nor Miss Rowrer,—when that Phil
came to Paris, after parting from Helia in the courtyard
near the circus, he hastened to the Hôtel des Artistes,
of which Helia had told him, treasuring in his
pocket her letter that recommended him to Suzanne.
Evening was falling, the street was dark, the house
somber. <i>Maillots</i> were drying at windows. An invisible
musical clown was picking out on his bottles lugubrious
tunes. But Phil thought of Helia, and was gay.
</p>

<p>
That night he slept little. He was in a hurry for the
morning, in order that he might carry Helia’s letter
to Mlle. Suzanne. He flung his window wide, and heard
Paris murmuring in the dark.
</p>

<p>
“Your name and profession,” said the landlady
next morning, as he came down. Phil signed the register,
writing underneath:
</p>

<p>
“Artist-painter.”
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_52' name='Page_52' href='#Page_52'>52</a></span>
</p>

<p>
“Artist-painter,” said the landlady. “I should have
liked that trade.”
</p>

<p>
“It’s not a bad one,” Phil said.
</p>

<p>
“But very difficult,” replied the landlady. “We
lately had a painter here—a very famous one; he painted
with his feet. He used to tell me the hardest thing
about it is to balance yourself on your hands while you
are painting! Ah, monsieur, the public no longer appreciates
the fine arts. If I were you, at your age, I’d
learn to walk on a ball.”
</p>

<p>
“I’ll tell that to Mlle. Suzanne,” Phil said to himself.
“She must be a real artiste—Mlle. Suzanne. And then
we’ll talk about Helia!”
</p>

<p>
He thought he should never get to Mlle. Suzanne, the
city was so enormous. He was meditating what he
should say to her, when, all of a sudden, the cab began
jolting over an atrocious stretch of pavement. Phil
stuck his head through the window just as the cab drew
up at the end of a blind alley.
</p>

<p>
“Say, <i>cocher</i>,” said Phil, “I think you’ve made a
mistake.”
</p>

<p>
“<i>Penses-tu, bébé!</i>” murmured the cabman.
</p>

<p>
“What do you say?”
</p>

<p>
“I say it’s all right.”
</p>

<p>
Phil got out. There were heads at all the windows;
the cab had made a stir in the little street.
</p>

<p>
“Perhaps she saw me come,” thought Phil, as he went
into the house.
</p>

<p>
It was the right address, but Mlle. Suzanne was not
at home.
</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<a name="i-067" id="i-067"></a>
<img src="images/i-067.png" width="343" height="550" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Phil arrives at the Hotel</p>
</div>

<p>
“You’ll find Mlle. Suzanne in the Boulevard de Vaugirard,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_53' name='Page_53' href='#Page_53'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_54' name='Page_54' href='#Page_54'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_55' name='Page_55' href='#Page_55'>55</a></span>
Number 13 <i>bis</i>. You go this way, turn to the
right, then to the left; there’s a door with plaster in
front of it. Then ask for Mlle. Suzanne.”
</p>

<p>
Phil paid the cabman and set off on foot. He walked
to the right, then to the left, and found himself in the
Boulevard de Vaugirard, at that time of day deserted.
Turning again to the left, he saw a heap of plaster with
a door behind it. Phil knocked timidly.
</p>

<p>
“<i>Entrez!</i>” cried a voice of thunder.
</p>

<p>
Phil had just time to pull down his cuffs. There
was no time to push up his cravat. “Come in!”—said in
such a tone allowed of no delay.
</p>

<p>
He entered. It was an astonishing place, heaped up
with mud, a chaos of clay and plaster. There were
buckets filled with dirty water, sprinklers, hammers,
pieces of old iron.
</p>

<p>
“Where am I?” thought Phil. “This must be a school
for sculpture done with the feet! Have I made a mistake?”
</p>

<p>
“Why don’t you come in?” roared the voice. “This
side! Don’t upset my statue! Look out for my ‘Fraternity’!
<i>Troun de Diou!</i> don’t tread on my potatoes!”
</p>

<p>
Phil passed over all obstacles and came into the presence
of the giant of the place. He was a short, thick-set
creature, whose gaping shirt showed a breast as hairy
as a monkey’s back. With his fingers he was kneading
clay, and he raised furious eyes to Phil. Behind him a
little monsieur lay stretched on a lounge, playing with
his monocle; but where was Suzanne?
</p>

<p>
“Monsieur—excuse me! I have made a mistake!”
Phil stammered.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_56' name='Page_56' href='#Page_56'>56</a></span>
</p>

<p>
“No harm done!” said the hairy one, mollified by
Phil’s correct dress and high standing collar; and he
added: “At your service, monsieur!”
</p>

<p>
Phil showed his letter. “I thought I should find here
Mlle. Suzanne, an actress,” he said.
</p>

<p>
“Suzanne! It’s me!” cried a gay voice from the
ceiling.
</p>

<p>
Phil looked up in the air. A charming blonde with
bare arms and feet, in a white waist and black petticoat,
was seated on top of a scaffolding, looking at Phil with
laughing eyes.
</p>

<p>
“Mlle. Suzanne, my model!” said the man.
</p>

<p>
“Let’s have the letter!” Suzanne cried.
</p>

<p>
“Catch!” said the sculptor, tossing up to her the
envelop weighted with a piece of clay.
</p>

<p>
“Well, I’m going!” said the little monsieur with the
monocle.
</p>

<p>
“Wait! don’t go!” Suzanne cried, with her letter in
her hand. “Let’s be correct. Messieurs, I present to
you Monsieur Phil, a young Englishman—”
</p>

<p>
“American,” rectified Phil.
</p>

<p>
“A friend of one of my friends—the famous Helia—it’s
too long to explain. M. Caracal, who writes in the—the—what-do-you-call-it—well,
no matter—And Poufaille,
sculptor, pupil of Boudin. There, the introductions
are made!”
</p>

<p>
“Monsieur—”
</p>

<p>
“Monsieur—”
</p>

<p>
“Monsieur—”
</p>

<p>
There were three bows.
</p>

<p>
“Ah! so you are an American and a painter,” Caracal
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_57' name='Page_57' href='#Page_57'>57</a></span>
said to Phil. “<i>Tiens! tiens! tiens!</i> I thought there
were only pork-packers in that country. <i>Salut, messieurs!</i>”
</p>

<p>
Before Phil could answer a word, Caracal had straddled
over the rough model of “Fraternity,” jumped
across the potatoes, and gone out, slamming the door
behind him.
</p>

<p>
“He’s not polite—M. Caracal,” Suzanne remarked;
“but you English don’t care!”
</p>

<p>
“I am an American!”
</p>

<p>
“Well, then, M. l’Américain, what are you waiting
for? Give me your hand and help me down!”
</p>

<p>
But she was on the ground before Phil could assist
her.
</p>

<p>
“Oh, my good Helia!” said Suzanne. “How glad I
am she is so happy!”
</p>

<p>
“The friends of our friends are <i>our</i> friends,” bawled
Poufaille, as he patted Phil on the shoulder with his
great hairy hand. “Sit down, Monsieur Phil.”
</p>

<p>
Phil sat down, much encouraged by their welcome.
</p>

<p>
Suzanne went and came lightly, moving things about.
She took a cigarette, lighted it, and threw it away. He
saw her approach the stove and raise the cover of the pot.
A bubbling noise came from it.
</p>

<p>
“Make yourself at home,” said Poufaille. Phil profited
by the permission to look around him. A hunk of
bread was lying on the model’s table. In an empty plate
a fork fraternized with a pipe. The shelves on the wall
were encumbered with rude canvases and rough models.
The sculptor was smoothing down his clay. The scene
did not attract the young American.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_58' name='Page_58' href='#Page_58'>58</a></span>
</p>

<p>
“Mademoiselle,” he said, preparing to retire, “I will
pay you a visit at the Impasse de Vaugirard.”
</p>

<p>
“So as not to find me? You’ll be taking something
for your cold, sure!”
</p>

<p>
“But, mademoiselle, I—I haven’t a cold!”
</p>

<p>
There was an explosion of laughter. Suzanne choked
and Poufaille bellowed with joy.
</p>

<p>
“Ah <i>ça</i>,” Suzanne cackled. “<i>Hou! hou!</i> but—<i>hou,
hou!</i> Helia taught you nothing, then?”
</p>

<p>
Phil stood amazed, with his hat in his hand.
</p>

<p>
“He’s nice, all the same, <i>l’Angliche</i>—we can’t let
him go away alone—something would happen to him!”
said Suzanne. “Put down your hat,” she added, “and
lunch with us!”
</p>

<p>
“Of course, of course!” shouted Poufaille.
</p>

<p>
“Now be polite, Monsieur Phil,” Suzanne went on:
“sit there and act as if you were in society. Help me peel
my potatoes!”
</p>

<p>
“Certainly!” Phil answered.-
</p>

<p>
And so it was that Phil, seated on a block of plaster,
was initiated by Suzanne into the <i>belles manières Parisiennes</i>.
</p>

<p>
“You must take off only the skins of the potatoes, like
this!” she said, while posting him in the picturesque
slang of the quarter.
</p>

<p>
“And to take something for your cold when you
haven’t a cold?” Phil asked.
</p>

<p>
“That means to be caught,” Suzanne answered.
“<i>Dame!</i> in Paris wit runs the streets!”
</p>

<p>
“Then this morning,” said Phil, “this morning when
a lady advised me to give up art and learn to walk on a
ball—it was to take something for my cold, was it?”

</p>

<p>
“For sure!” replied Suzanne.
</p>

<p>
A noise started them. It was Poufaille working himself
up to a fit of anger. “<i>Troun de Diou!</i> She was
right, that lady of yours!” he cried, hammering the clay
with a terrific blow of his fist.
</p>

<p>
“Hello!” Phil said in a fright; “is he going crazy?”
</p>

<p>
The sculptor’s eyes were out of his head. With formidable
blows he was flattening the bust, shouting <i>rinforzando</i>:
“Right a hundred times over—a thousand
times, a million times!”
</p>

<p>
“What’s the matter, M. Poufaille?” asked Phil,
rising.
</p>

<p>
“What’s the matter? To think that those pigs of
the jury refused my statue of ‘Fraternity’ for the
Salon! You understand my indignation,” said Poufaille,
taking Phil by the lapel of his coat. “Do you
understand? <i>Hein!</i> do you understand?”
</p>

<p>
“I—I—I—understand your indignation—I—I share
it,” Phil answered between the shakes.
</p>

<p>
“It’s enough to set one crazy!” shouted Poufaille;
“but—<i>sacré mille tonnerres</i>!—Phil, take off your collar;
the sight of you with that instrument of torture
chokes me!”
</p>

<p>
“Well, if that’s all that’s needed to calm you!” Phil
answered, and with a turn of the hand he pulled off
cravat and collar.
</p>

<p>
“<i>À la bonne heure!</i> I breathe!” said Poufaille.
</p>

<p>
“<i>Mon petit</i> Poufaille, where’s the salt?” Suzanne
asked, without paying the slightest heed to the sculptor’s
rage.
</p>

<p>
“There,” answered Poufaille, “in the tobacco-jar.”
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_62' name='Page_62' href='#Page_62'>62</a></span>
</p>

<p>
“And now, to dinner!” Suzanne called. “Here’s
pig’s rump ragout!”
</p>

<p>
“To dinner!” shouted Poufaille.
</p>

<p>
“To dinner!” repeated Phil.
</p>

<p>
During the meal Phil, who had had a French lesson
from Suzanne, tried to give her a lesson in geography.
He spoke of America. But Suzanne declared that all
those names hurt her head. And besides, she didn’t
believe a word of it.
</p>

<p>
“Let’s talk of love instead,” she said. “Are you
greatly in love with my friend Helia?”
</p>

<p>
Phil blushed.
</p>

<p>
“She is so pretty,” Suzanne continued; “and
she’s not been spoiled, I can tell you! All the more
merit in her to be good—she’s worth more than all of
us together!—not to speak of her being pretty—pretty!
That doesn’t hurt anything, does it, Monsieur
Phil?”
</p>

<p>
Phil smiled.
</p>

<p>
“Oh, if I were a man!” Suzanne declared, enthusiastically,
“I’d make a fool of myself for Helia! Tell me
all about her,” she went on. “Love-stories are so
amusing!”
</p>

<p>
Phil told about the little Saint John, the lamb, the
game of Wolf, the poster-umbrella, the dressing-room
under the benches, and his last interview with Helia,
when she had given him the address of the Hôtel des
Artistes and his letter of introduction.
</p>

<p>
Suzanne drank in his words, turn by turn moved to
tenderness or laughter.
</p>

<p>
“Oh, it does me good to hear it! There’s love for
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_63' name='Page_63' href='#Page_63'>63</a></span>
you!” she cried, putting her hand to her heart with a
gesture of the stage.
</p>

<p>
“I see that you are an actress,” Phil observed.
</p>

<p>
“An actress? I? <i>Penses-tu, bébé?</i> I appeared once
in a <i>cabaret artistique</i>—it disgusted me with the theater
for the rest of my life!”
</p>

<p>
“You forget that you play the Muse at our reunion,”
Poufaille interrupted.
</p>

<p>
“Oh, yes! the Muse,” Suzanne replied. “You see,
Phil, since they bore themselves to death in Paris, those
from each province meet together and give balls and
receptions and lectures and what not; and they give
dinners, too—and sing to the sound of the hurdy-gurdy.”
</p>

<p>
“I’m the hurdy-gurdy!” cried Poufaille.
</p>

<p>
“And I’m the one that sings,” added Suzanne. “I
eat garlic that day and improvise in <i>patois</i>—and every
one thinks I belong to his province. <i>Et aïe donc, et vive
la joie!</i>”
</p>

<p>
“<i>Et vive la joie!</i>” took up Phil.
</p>

<p>
They were now a trio of friends.
</p>

<p>
“By the way, <i>mon cher</i>, where do you live?” asked
Poufaille, who was already saying “thou” to him and
calling him <i>mon cher</i> and <i>mon vieux</i> without knowing
either his name or address. Phil told the hotel he was at.
</p>

<p>
“<i>Allons donc!</i> but that’s a quarter of the <i>arrivés</i>!”
Poufaille said scornfully; “you have only bourgeois in
that quarter, medal-men, members of the jury—the pigs!
You’re done for if you stay there!”
</p>

<p>
“You mustn’t stay there a day longer!” declared
Suzanne. “Come over here; we’ll present you to the
<i>copains</i> [comrades].”
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_64' name='Page_64' href='#Page_64'>64</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Hesitation was impossible.
</p>

<p>
“All right,” Phil said, as he put on his collar and
cravat. “I will leave to-day.”
</p>

<p>
“Will you come to my house?” Suzanne asked. “No
ceremony, you know! I’ll bring you a mattress.”
</p>

<p>
“Oh!” exclaimed Phil.
</p>

<p>
“Or else here,” said Poufaille. “You can sleep in the
corner beside the potatoes, <i>hein</i>? Will that do?”
</p>

<p>
“No, thanks,” said Phil; “I’ll see you again to-morrow!
<i>Au revoir!</i>”
</p>

<p>
The same evening, having found a room, Phil left his
hotel.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_65' name='Page_65' href='#Page_65'>65</a></span>

<h3>
CHAPTER V
<br />
AN INITIATION INTO ART
</h3>

<p>
The next day Phil returned his new friends’
hospitality by taking them to lunch.
</p>

<p>
“Where are we going?” Suzanne asked.
</p>

<p>
“Where you wish,” answered Phil.
</p>

<p>
“To Mère Michel’s, then.”
</p>

<p>
Suzanne delighted in this restaurant. The food was
bad, but there was laughter. Sometimes messieurs with
high hats invited her to chic places. Suzanne would refuse
the chic restaurants and take them to Mère Michel’s,
where their hats brought out thunders of applause.
</p>

<p>
Phil had a Derby hat and so received a more modest
welcome. For that matter, few people were there when
they arrived. Poufaille did the honors of the place.
</p>

<p>
“Do you see those two photos on the wall, Phil? That—hum!—that’s
mine, my two statues—‘Liberty,’ ‘Fraternity.’
Do you see this photo in the frame? <i>Salut!</i>
That means a year’s credit—it’s from Lionsot, a Prix-de-Rome
man; he paid Mère Michel with an autograph
dedication at the base of his ‘Light-Footed Achilles.’”
</p>

<p>
“<i>Cours après!</i>” laughed Suzanne.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile the customers kept coming in, some with
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_66' name='Page_66' href='#Page_66'>66</a></span>
canvases and paint-boxes, others with only their long
hair and unkempt beards.
</p>

<p>
“That one’s a painter—that one a sculptor—and that
a musician,” said Poufaille. “The empty place, there in
the corner, is the place of Socrate, a <i>type épatant</i>! Musician,
sculptor, painter, and poet, and philosopher—a
whole world in himself!”
</p>

<p>
“Ah!” uttered Phil, respectfully, as he looked at the
empty place.
</p>

<p>
Nothing was heard for a time but the rattle of knives
and forks; then there was a great deal of laughter, with
cries that punctuated conversations on art. Heads were
turned for a few entrances. A pretty model with a cloud
of gauze for a scarf was greeted with “Kiss, kiss!” An
old man with a gilt band round his cap only called forth
howls.
</p>

<p>
“Eh! you old Gaul!”
</p>

<p>
“<i>Vieux coq!</i>”
</p>

<p>
“Your ‘kiss, kiss,’ makes me laugh,” said the old man.
“Do you know to-day what ‘kiss, kiss,’ means? Oh, yes!
in the old days women fell in love—under the Empire!”
</p>

<p>
“<i>Ta bouche, bébé!</i>”
</p>

<p>
“<i>Ferme ça</i> [shut up]!”
</p>

<p>
“He is the inspector of the Louvre roofs,” Poufaille
said to Phil. “I am well acquainted with him. I see
him every day.”
</p>

<p>
Phil opened his eyes wide; everything was new to
him. From his seat he had also a view of the bar alongside.
While Mère Michel served in the room of the artistes,
Père Michel stretched out his immense bulk behind
the counter.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_67' name='Page_67' href='#Page_67'>67</a></span>
</p>

<p>
“That man he’s serving is the lackey of the Duke of
Morgania,” observed Suzanne.
</p>

<p>
“Does the Duke of Morgania live near here?” Phil
interrupted. He had read the name in the newspapers.
</p>

<p>
“Almost opposite,” Suzanne answered.
</p>

<p>
“Ah!” Phil said, with the same shade of respect which
he had shown before the empty seat of Socrate, never
dreaming that he would one day be the friend of both
the <i>grand seigneur</i> and the poet-philosopher.
</p>

<p>
Just then Socrate entered. Poufaille nudged Phil with
his elbow. Phil looked. He saw Socrate seat himself in
his corner, call the <i>garçon</i>, order three or four dishes
and a liter of wine, hurriedly, at haphazard, like a man
overwhelmed with thought and with no time to lose.
</p>

<p>
“He’s begun a work on the Louvre—something tremendous!”
Poufaille informed Phil.
</p>

<p>
“What is it like?” Phil asked.
</p>

<p>
“No one knows!”
</p>

<p>
Phil examined the man who seemed to be carrying the
weight of a world.
</p>

<p>
His skull was nearly bald, his forehead bulging out,
his hair about his ears, while his beard half hid a grimace;
his eye was alert and sagacious.
</p>

<p>
“He does resemble him, though,” Phil observed.
</p>

<p>
“Resembles whom?” said Poufaille.
</p>

<p>
“Socrates the ancient.”
</p>

<p>
“So there was another?” Poufaille asked.
</p>

<p>
When his meal was over, Socrate arose, sad-mannered
and dignified.
</p>

<p>
“He’s going over to the Café des Deux Magots,” said
Poufaille. “Let’s go too—you’ll see him nearer.”
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_68' name='Page_68' href='#Page_68'>68</a></span>
</p>

<p>
The Deux Magots was the rendezvous of different
bands—the Band of Cherche-Midi (look out for twelve
o’clock!), made up of rich Americans playing Bohemia
and frequenting the Deux Magots in appropriate costume;
the band of the Red-headed Goat, artists who despised
art and occupied themselves with socialism; and
there were others besides.
</p>

<p>
No one went to the Deux Magots for its coffee—they
went there for Socrate and Caracal. There could be
heard Socrate, musician, painter, and poet, speaking of
high art; the new men drank in his words.
</p>

<p>
One day, in his enthusiasm, Charley, the millionaire
Bohemian, proposed to take him to America to give lectures
on “The Artistic Atmosphere”—by Jove!
</p>

<p>
“Are there any cafés in America?” Socrate asked.
</p>

<p>
“<i>Hélas, non!</i>”
</p>

<p>
“Then I stay where I am,” replied Socrate, the man
of manly decisions; “when America has cafés I’ll go
over—not before. <i>Arrangez-vous!</i>”
</p>

<p>
“You’re great, by Jove!” cried Charley.
</p>

<p>
Socrate dazzled the young. He talked of everything,
social questions included.
</p>

<p>
“The distribution of wealth is badly made,” he said.
“You have genius and no money—and you’ll be obliged
to work, to produce and to sell! To sell, do you understand?
To cheapen yourself, to prostitute your genius!
In society as I dream of it, the artist, freed from material
bonds, would soar in serene heights.”
</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<a name="i-083" id="i-083"></a>
<img src="images/i-083.png" width="469" height="550" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Socrate at Deux Magots</p>
</div>

<p>
Socrate cited the example of Lionsot, the Prix-de-Rome
man, the sculptor of “Light-footed Achilles.”
“He had the Prix de Rome—he has turned out badly!
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_69' name='Page_69' href='#Page_69'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_70' name='Page_70' href='#Page_70'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_71' name='Page_71' href='#Page_71'>71</a></span>
Yet there was good in him: to pay a wretched debt for
food with an artistic autograph—that was noble!”
</p>

<p>
Most of them, in fact, acted like the famous Lionsot—for
example, whenever Mère Michel demanded her money.
</p>

<p>
Caracal, who was not so deep but more brilliant, enjoyed
a different prestige.
</p>

<p>
First of all, he lived in the Grands Quartiers, in a
house with an elevator! so it was said. And while the
others ate at Mère Michel’s, Caracal would be supping at
Montmartre—<i>suprême élégance</i>!
</p>

<p>
Besides, he wrote in the newspapers. For a little article,
for one’s name cited in the “Tocsin”—how low
would not one stoop to obtain such a favor!
</p>

<p>
“‘Oysters and Melons,’ still life by X——,” or else
“‘Old Tree-trunk,’ landscape by Z——”; and Z——
and X—— would march off together into immortality.
</p>

<p>
Caracal, behind his monocle, observed the different
bands, in his heart deriding every one. He cross-questioned
the comrades, and composed his newspaper <i>chroniques</i>
on the café table.
</p>

<p>
“<i>Eh bien!</i> anything for my paper? A nice little
scandal? Something strong?”
</p>

<p>
“I’ve got something new,” the good-natured Poufaille
would say; “at my house, in the courtyard, a woman has
been found dead.”
</p>

<p>
“Bravo! Young? pretty?”
</p>

<p>
“No, old.”
</p>

<p>
“And dead—how?” Caracal asked. “From drink?”
</p>

<p>
“No, of starvation. She was keeping alive the four
children of a neighbor who was palsied; and she killed
herself working.”
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_72' name='Page_72' href='#Page_72'>72</a></span>
</p>

<p>
“Old and poor! but that’s not interesting; it’s only
tiresome!”
</p>

<p>
And he went on with the conversation, in which music,
poetry, love, sculpture, and crime made a horrible mixture.
</p>

<p>
Phil, coming up from the province, was made gloomy
by all this noise. These never-ending dissertations made
his head turn. It was the invasion of his brain by a
world whose existence he had never suspected, of whose
virtues and vices he had no idea.
</p>

<p>
When his work was over, the <i>copains</i> took walks with
him through Paris and showed him such “Parisian”
places as the Rue Mouffetard and the Rue Saint-Médard.
</p>

<p>
Paris proper did not count; you had to cross its whole
width and go as far as Montmartre to become really
Parisian. All had a single ambition—to be the painter
of the wretchedly poor, and of street-women, an easy art
brought into fashion by a few noisy successes. They
initiated Phil to <i>their</i> Paris, to the Paris of the <i>fosses
aux lions</i>, of leprous quays, of rag-pickers’ alleys, where
children played hide-and-seek behind heaps of refuse.
When Phil wished to go and dream by the banks of the
Seine, they led him to the banks of the Bièvre, stinking
like a charnel-house.
</p>

<p>
“<i>Hein!</i> Don’t you see it’s beautiful in color?” they
said to him. Phil acknowledged, as he sniffed, that the
Bièvre diffused an “artistic atmosphere.”
</p>

<p>
The truth is, Phil soon had enough of such loafing.
Of course, he wasn’t a genius like the others—nothing
came to him easily. An organism like Socrate, painter-poet-philosopher,
was incomprehensible to him. Such a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_73' name='Page_73' href='#Page_73'>73</a></span>
man, doing a colossal work on the Louvre and studying
the social question in cafés, seemed great to him. As for
himself, he was conscious that he had not such gifts. For
him work was necessary, a great deal of work, and he set
himself to it resolutely: studies at the life-class, sketches
in the street, libraries, museums—he went everywhere
and did a little of everything. He prepared ardently
for his admission to the studio; he frequented the schools
and appeared but seldom at the Deux Magots.
</p>

<p>
Socrate, isolated in pipe-smoke like a god in a cloud,
condescended to take an interest in him.
</p>

<p>
“You work too much, young man! Look out! Think
less of the material side and trust to inspiration. Work
is good. Glory is better. Think of glory, young man!”
</p>

<p>
“<i>Hélas!</i>” Phil thought; “how can you have glory
without work?”
</p>

<p>
He had it a few days later—the glory which was dear
to the heart of Socrate.
</p>

<p>
It was the day of his reception to the studio. He had
only to give his family name, first name, and particulars
to be asked to get up on a table—“Step lively <i>et plus
vite que ça</i>!”—and to see around him a howling crowd,
armed with brushes and palettes, shouting: “Philidor!”
</p>

<p>
“An American speaking French—where did you come
from? <i>En voilà un drôle de type!</i>”
</p>

<p>
“My—my ancestors were French,” said Phil.
</p>

<p>
“An American who has ancestors!”
</p>

<p>
“Philidor de Longueville—” stammered Phil.
</p>

<p>
“Philidor! Philidor!”
</p>

<p>
“Sing us something!”
</p>

<p>
“Take off your clothes!”
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_74' name='Page_74' href='#Page_74'>74</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Phil began undressing.
</p>

<p>
“Step lively <i>et plus vite que ça</i>!”
</p>

<p>
Fifty savages were howling, yelling, laughing, and
hissing around him.
</p>

<p>
“Enough! enough!”
</p>

<p>
“Encore! encore!”
</p>

<p>
“Paint him blue!”
</p>

<p>
“No, no!”
</p>

<p>
“Yes, yes!”
</p>

<p>
Phil was already stripped to the waist, facing the
great window in full light. At his feet the confused mass
of students was hushed—they stood in a circle around
him. He heard their approving murmurs as they admired
his thoroughbred muscles, his broad shoulders, the
nervous slenderness of his waist.
</p>

<p>
“Bravo, l’Américain! There’s a man who’s built!
You’d say he was an antique—<i>c’est un costeau</i>—he’ll
be a great boy! I wouldn’t want him to punch me—he’s
a good fellow, too! Enough! enough! Dress
yourself, Philidor! A <i>Ban</i> for Philidor!”
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p>“Pan! pan! pan! pan! pan!</p>
<p class="i3">Pan! pan!”</p>
</div></div>

<p>
Thus Phil made acquaintance with the intoxication of
glory.
</p>

<p>
Profiting by the moment of silence, a grave voice arose.
</p>

<p>
“The welcome!”
</p>

<p>
Phil, over the heads, saw amid the smoke a bearded
face under a great bald forehead.
</p>

<p>
“Socrate has just come in,” a pupil said to Phil.
“Socrate, an astonishing man—painter-poet!”
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_75' name='Page_75' href='#Page_75'>75</a></span>
</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_76' name='Page_76' href='#Page_76'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_77' name='Page_77' href='#Page_77'>77</a></span>
</p>

<p>
“I know Socrate,” Phil said with pride.
</p>

<p>
“The welcome!” Socrate repeated.
</p>

<p>
“<i>C’est ça!</i> That’s it, the welcome!” the whole hall
cried.
</p>

<p>
“That means you must pay the drinks for the studio,”
the pupil explained. “It’s the custom here.”
</p>

<p>
“Messieurs, whenever you wish,” said Phil.
</p>

<p>
“At the Deux Magots and at once,” Socrate insisted,
like a man accustomed to prompt decisions.
</p>

<p>
Phil dressed himself, and all went out into the streets,
<i>en route</i> for the Deux Magots. Socrate, the glory of the
studio, leader of men, and genius—Socrate himself gave
his arm to Phil.
</p>

<p>
“Say, young man,” whispered Socrate, who was master
of himself in any crowd, “you couldn’t lend me
twenty francs?”
</p>

<p>
After this glorious day Phil’s existence seemed flat.
From his childhood he had been accustomed to free
air, to liberty in great spaces; and now he had to
live a cloistered life, shut up in himself, but with
work, it is true, for distraction. He worked sadly and
alone.
</p>

<p>
In front of his window, on the other side of the Seine,
stretched the Louvre. Beyond, far away, above the
smoke of Paris, the church of the Sacré-Cœur lifted its
Oriental dome. To the right was the Pont Neuf with the
point of the island of the Cité and Notre Dame; to the
left was the greenery of the Tuileries, the Grand Palais,
the Arc de Triomphe.
</p>

<p>
Now and then Suzanne came. But Suzanne was far
from being Helia. Her frivolity made Phil shy, though
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_78' name='Page_78' href='#Page_78'>78</a></span>
her babbling talk amused him. She kept Phil posted,
telling him all the important news.
</p>

<p>
Poufaille, for example, was surely going to give up
sculpture and become a painter—l’Institut would have
to look out for itself! They had rejected his statue. “<i>Eh
bien</i>, they’ll see! And then, paintings sell better!”
added Suzanne.
</p>

<p>
“Does he sell his paintings?” Phil asked with astonishment.
“What does he do for a living?”
</p>

<p>
“He has something to do at the Louvre, I believe,”
Suzanne said. But she immediately became silent and
bit her lip.
</p>

<p>
“A copy, of course—ornaments for a <i>plafond</i>?” Phil
asked.
</p>

<p>
“I believe so,” Suzanne answered, fearing to say too
much.
</p>

<p>
“There is some secret,” Phil thought.
</p>

<p>
But the very day she told him all this his door opened
suddenly and Poufaille entered with a furious air.
</p>

<p>
“Ah, the pigs!” he cried, shaking his fist toward the
Louvre; and he threw into a corner a tool which Phil
took at first for a sculptor’s instrument. It was a spade.
</p>

<p>
“What’s that?” asked Phil. “What’s the matter?”
</p>

<p>
“That’s my spade; and the matter is they are pigs!”
</p>

<p>
“Have they taken your <i>plafond</i> away from you?”
Phil asked on a chance.
</p>

<p>
“What <i>plafond</i>?” Poufaille cried. “They’re trying
to keep me from cultivating my potatoes!”
</p>

<p>
“Potatoes?” exclaimed Phil.
</p>

<p>
“Phil doesn’t know about it,” Suzanne said to Poufaille.

</p>

<p>
“<i>Eh bien—tant pis</i>—it’s a secret,” Poufaille cried;
“but I’m going to tell it. And, besides, a secret chokes
me, like your collars!”
</p>

<p>
“If it’s a secret, I don’t want to know it,” Phil
answered.
</p>

<p>
“<i>Si, si!</i> You must. I’ll tell it to you—under seal
of secrecy! See here,” Poufaille went on; “I’m gardener
at the Louvre!”
</p>

<p>
“Nothing wonderful in that,” Phil said, as he looked
across the Seine at the flower-beds and green turf at the
foot of the Louvre façade.
</p>

<p>
“Not there,” Poufaille explained. “Not down there—but
up yonder! I’m gardener of the Louvre
roofs!”
</p>

<p>
Looking where Poufaille pointed, Phil perceived, high,
high up against the blue sky, tufts of greenery actually
growing above that part of the Louvre Palace. He knew
there were a few roof-gardens in Paris; but he had never
noticed this one.
</p>

<p>
“Now you understand!” Poufaille said, with gesticulation.
“There’s no means of keeping up an understanding
with them! It has ended by wearing me out.
Always roses, iris, and gillyflowers, and gillyflowers, iris,
and roses. That sort of stuff won’t fill my stomach! I
wanted to plant potatoes. I could live on them! But
they’ve refused permission—and I tell you, they’re
pigs!”
</p>

<p>
“But they—who are they?”
</p>

<p>
“Eh! They—when I say ‘they’ I mean <i>him</i>!”
</p>

<p>
“Well, who is he?”
</p>

<p>
“The old guardian of the Louvre roofs.”
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_82' name='Page_82' href='#Page_82'>82</a></span>
</p>

<p>
“Ah, yes,” said Phil; “I saw him at Mère Michel’s.
And so you’re his gardener?”
</p>

<p>
“I am—that is, I was!”
</p>

<p>
An idea came to Phil. He was stifled in his room; he
might have—up there, close by—a garden to himself.
</p>

<p>
“<i>Dis donc</i>, old Poufaille, what if they gave me the
gardener’s place?”
</p>

<p>
“That could be done easily; but I warn you—you’ll
have no right to cultivate potatoes!”
</p>

<p>
“I’ll be content with flowers.”
</p>

<p>
“What eccentricity!” Poufaille exclaimed, in the
height of astonishment. “Ah, you’re very American!”

<h3>
CHAPTER VI
<br />
THE HANGING GARDENS OF PARIS
</h3>

<p>
Henceforth Phil had glorious days. Poufaille,
whom he made his assistant gardener, dug and
watered and trimmed the alleys. It increased
Phil’s expenses, but what a pleasure for him, after work,
to pursue his dreams as he walked amid the flowers!
</p>

<p>
Long months had gone by since Phil’s reception into
the studio. He had passed through many trials since
then, and known discouragements and dogged labor and
the joy of progress. Should he walk on a ball to earn his
bread or hold the globe in his hand like a Cæsar? An
effort, and then another, and an effort once more! The
periods of want did not discourage him. Still he had
a sad existence, and his only amusement was to come up
here and breathe the pure air.
</p>

<p>
The garden of the Louvre, on top of Perrault’s colonnade,
was a resting-place for the pigeons in their flight
over Paris. They lighted there in bands, heedless of Phil
and Poufaille. But one day the birds were all a-flutter.
The hanging garden had its Semiramis—Helia!
</p>

<p>
Phil, while they held their dismayed flight above him,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_84' name='Page_84' href='#Page_84'>84</a></span>
sat at the feet of Helia, who looked down and smiled at
him. To the young girl it was a strange place. For
thirty years the inspector of the Louvre roofs—the same
man whom Phil had already seen at Mère Michel’s—had
been making this garden, bringing up little by little the
earth in which the plants grew, and the pebbles which
covered the alleys. Boxes hidden among the foliage held
great shrubs; the perfume of iris and gillyflower, of
mignonette and roses, breathed from the flower-beds.
Hanging over the borders were ripening currants and
peaches and apples; and laurels gave their purple flowers.
A whole row of statues and busts outlined the plots.
Helia pointed to the busts.
</p>

<p>
“The one who looks like a circus-rider with his big
mustaches—who is he?”
</p>

<p>
“Napoleon III,” Phil answered.
</p>

<p>
“And that other with his hair brushed up to a point
like a clown?”
</p>

<p>
“That is Louis-Philippe.”
</p>

<p>
“And this one? and that one?”
</p>

<p>
Phil went on explaining his aërial paradise.
</p>

<p>
“This is Grévy, that is Carnot; here is M. Thiers—these
are all official busts. When the government changes
they pack them off to the attic, and the inspector has put
them here to ornament his garden.”
</p>

<p>
“And this arm-chair on which I am sitting, with all
its gilding rubbed off? Is that official also?” Helia
asked, examining the wood, carved with palms, and the
red velvet embroidered with the attributes of Law and
Justice.
</p>

<p>
“It’s a relic of the Revolution of ’48,” answered Phil;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_85' name='Page_85' href='#Page_85'>85</a></span>
“we found it only lately in the attic—it was King Louis-Philippe’s
throne.”
</p>

<p>
“A king’s throne!” Helia said, jumping up. “How
can you think of it for a poor girl like me? You would
be better in it, Phil. Seat yourself; I wish you to—I
command you!” she said, imitating what she considered
the royal tone.
</p>

<p>
“Well, since you wish it—”
</p>

<p>
“Yes; it’s your place—and here is mine,” she added,
as she seated herself at Phil’s feet. “Stay there, Phil—leave
me at your feet. I am so happy!”
</p>

<p>
Happy! She could not have found words to express
it all! For months and months and months she had
thought of Phil every day and every hour—Phil, friend
of her childhood and youth, who had loved her well, who
would have protected her against Cemetery—Phil, her
hero! And now she saw him again; he was there before
her, her head was resting on his knees, in the calm of the
beautiful day. How could she have told her happiness?
</p>

<p>
Phil, on his arrival in Paris, had thought less about
Helia at first, overburdened as he was with all his new
impressions; but the environment in which he lived was
not pleasant to him. His illusions had been cast to
earth; he was in an abyss of temptations from which he
could not, like Suzanne, free himself by a smile or a
shrug. But he soon regained possession of himself; he
made of Helia an ideal. He knew no young girl of his
own sphere, and he took refuge in the thought of Helia
as in a place of safety. She personified his innocent
youth. Phil still had in him the old Puritan austerity—he
whose family Bible showed on its margin this proud
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_86' name='Page_86' href='#Page_86'>86</a></span>
device written in faded ink by some persecuted ancestor:
“No judge but God, no woman but the wife!” He was
grateful to Helia because her remembrance protected
him; because she seemed to him always so pure.
</p>

<p>
Accordingly, when Helia came back, with the superb
confidence of youth which believes in the everlastingness
of things, Phil looked on her again with joy. In spite of
the rude life she was leading, she was more modest and
charming than ever; and she was so beautiful! Helia
came into Phil’s life at a dangerous moment—an accomplice
of the sun and the fragrance of roses.
</p>

<p>
“How beautiful she is!” Phil thought, as he looked
at her faultless features and her eyes, in which a flame
seemed burning.
</p>

<p>
“How handsome you are!” Helia said to him, scanning
his firm expression and look of frankness.
</p>

<p>
They talked of one thing and another, thinking of each
other all the while; or else they remained without speaking,
he on his throne, she at his feet, their gaze lost in the
tumultuous, motionless ocean of houses.
</p>

<p>
Paris was around them with its muffled murmur. At
the height where they were, a pigeon’s cooing subdued
the noise of three million human beings; at their feet
carriages filled the streets, moving on ceaselessly, like a
silent river. Helia looked to the horizon before her.
First of all she descried, among the trees of the Quai
de Conti, on the other side of the Seine, Phil’s little
window. That was her first halting-place. La Monnaie
(the Mint), with all its millions on one side, and the
Institut (the palace of the Academy), with its Immortals,
on the other, interested her less. For her they were
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_87' name='Page_87' href='#Page_87'>87</a></span>
simply side-pieces, setting Phil’s attic in relief. Just
behind, over an immensity of roofs, the Palais du Luxembourg
served as a background. Farther still, to right
and left and everywhere, even in the distant blue, could
be seen cupolas and spires, towers and domes. The
church of the Sacré-Cœur rose above this ocean like a
cliff at whose foot the smoke beat up like waves.
</p>

<p>
“How beautiful it is! Oh, Phil, is it not beautiful?
And how happy I am!” said Helia.
</p>

<p>
In those first days the strangeness of the place intimidated
her; even the busts took from the privacy of
the spot. But she soon came to look on them as old
friends, treating them as equals, as sovereign to sovereign.
When Phil was painting and herself posing for
him, she would tranquilly disembarrass herself of her
collar and place it on the shoulders of Napoleon III and
crown the blessed head of Louis-Philippe with her flowery
hat. She sat on the old throne, and presided without
ceremony over the assembled monarchs.
</p>

<p>
The little garden seemed immense to her, for it held
their happiness. In reality, it occupied only one angle of
the middle pediment above the colonnade which looks
toward Saint-Germain l’Auxerrois.
</p>

<p>
From that corner, flat as a Russian steppe, stretched
the immense oblong of the zinc roofs which surround the
court of the Louvre, forming a desert six hundred yards
long by thirty wide. Farther on, pointed roofs and <i>pavillons</i>
and deep gutters invited to adventure, and they
amused themselves in exploring their domain.
</p>

<p>
Especially the side toward the river attracted them.
They went along the balustrade above the Place Saint-Germain,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_88' name='Page_88' href='#Page_88'>88</a></span>
and turned to the right above the Quai du
Louvre. An enormous piece of decoration, composed
of bucklers and lances and fasces of piled arms sculptured
in the stone, terminated the flat roof, like an army
watching over the frontier of their empire. They went
down a little iron ladder across the Galerie des Bijoux
and turned to the left above the Galerie d’Apollon.
Helia followed hesitatingly; it seemed to her that the
whole city was looking at them.
</p>

<p>
In reality, no one could see her. They were shut off
from the Seine by the leafy tree-tops; only the cries of
children playing on the lawns came up to them, mingled
with the twittering of sparrows. The next moment they
found themselves in gutters deep as the beds of rivers.
They discovered peaceable corners which the old kings
of France seemed to have built expressly for themselves.
At times they might have thought themselves in gardens
of stone.
</p>

<p>
There were lofty chimneys profusely carved with garlands;
the leaves of acanthus and laurel and oak were
interlaced with strange flowers, among which laughed the
loves and satyrs of the Renaissance. Cornucopias poured
at their feet their marble fruits; and goddesses, standing
against the blue sky, trumpeted through their shells the
happiness of their loves.
</p>

<p>
In the distance their own garden seemed like an oasis
of greenery. After long reveries it was sweet to them to
come back and breathe the air of its roses and to hear
the birds twitter in the shrubbery of their paradise.
</p>

<p>
Helia, since she had made Phil’s acquaintance, blushed
for her ignorance. She had given to reading all the time
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_89' name='Page_89' href='#Page_89'>89</a></span>
left her by her exercises; there was in her something else
than superb physical beauty. Sometimes, with the blood
in her face and glad to be alive, after scaling with an
acrobat’s agility the obstacles of the roof, she would
stop and ask Phil questions which showed a thoughtful
mind. She listened to his replies with attention, little
by little ridding herself of the common speech and narrow
views of her trade.
</p>

<p>
“Say, Phil,” she remarked to him one day as they were
looking out over the great courtyard of the Louvre beneath
them, “Blondin would have crossed that, dancing
on a tight-rope! I believe I could do it, too,” she added,
so light and strong did she feel. But she soon saw that
such ideas were not pleasing to Phil: he loved her in
spite of her being a circus-girl and not because she was
one.
</p>

<p>
At once she spoke of other things.
</p>

<p>
“No one ever taught me anything, Phil; teach me, you
who speak so well.”
</p>

<p>
Phil was radiant. Encouraged by her desire to know,
he willingly became her educator and poured out his
knowledge for her. He modeled Helia’s mind on his own.
She belonged to him more and more. She thought like
him, through him, for him. Her maiden intelligence
gave itself up to him. Phil was grateful to her for the
progress she was making. A look from her limpid eyes,
a grasp of her hand, were his sweet reward. They moved
him more deeply than words of love could have done;
and more and more Helia grew to be a part of him. Phil
talked to her of Paris and of the persons he knew there.
Helia answered with her clear good sense.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_90' name='Page_90' href='#Page_90'>90</a></span>
</p>

<p>
“The dirty banks of the Bièvre—what an idea—when
the Seine is so pretty at Saint-Cloud! But perhaps
ugliness is easier to paint?”
</p>

<p>
“Perhaps,” said Phil. “That must be the reason.”
“As for me,” Helia said, “I’m only an ignorant girl—I
love beautiful things!”
</p>

<p>
“Look, Phil, what is that we see down there?” she
said one day, as she was leaning over a skylight.
</p>

<p>
Phil looked; they were just above one of the halls of
the Egyptian Museum, and they saw strange objects
beneath them—statues of gods, mummies of kings, a
pell-mell of fallen grandeur. A squatting Sphinx lifted
its head and stared at them. Through the dusty glass
they might have thought they were looking into an entire
past, engulfed in the depths of the sea. A broken column
spoke of the crumbling of temples, a mutilated god of
the overthrow of altars, a dun-colored sarcophagus
of the heaping up of the sand beneath desert winds.
Phil explained these dead things to Helia and gave
them life.
</p>

<p>
“Ah,” Helia said, “what happiness it is to know!”
</p>

<p>
They were alone, half kneeling on the roof, their heads
bent toward the skylight; around them Paris murmured
like an ocean. They could have imagined themselves the
survivors of a world destroyed—the only woman and the
only man escaped from the cataclysm, while the mysterious
Sphinx raised its head as if to say: “Love! for life
passes as a dream!”
</p>

<p>
Phil and Helia arose in silence and came back to their
oasis, while above them, in the blue sky, the doves pursued
one another.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_91' name='Page_91' href='#Page_91'>91</a></span>
</p>

</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_92' name='Page_92' href='#Page_92'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_93' name='Page_93' href='#Page_93'>93</a></span>
</p>

<p>
“Look at the birds,” said Helia. “Come quick and
give them their grain.”
</p>

<p>
The doves, as free as those of St. Mark’s or of the
Guildhall, had quickly accustomed themselves to her,
and the presence of Helia did not trouble them.
</p>

<p>
It was a pleasure to Phil to see Helia in the midst of
their cooings and the beating of their wings. They came
to eat from her hand. As one of them lighted on her
shoulder, Helia had an inspiration. She took the dove
and gave a long kiss to its wings.
</p>

<p>
“Here, Phil! Do like me!” she said, presenting the
other wing to him. “And now, fly away!” she added,
letting loose the bird, who in its flight seemed to sow
Paris with kisses.
</p>

<p>
And so the days passed. It was usually in the afternoons
that they met. In the mornings Phil worked and
Helia studied at home or else rehearsed at the circus.
Poufaille took care of the garden. The inspector made
his rounds, and sometimes, in the afternoon, watched
Helia and Phil from his hiding-place behind a bush.
</p>

<p>
The old man “of my time” confessed that lovers still
existed, and that these were real and kissed each other
as they did in “his time” under the Third Empire. But
usually they were alone. Suzanne came only now and
then to pick a rose.
</p>

<p>
“What bears you are!” she said as she looked at Phil
and Helia. “How can you stay in this desert, with
nothing but flowers and flowers, and pigeons and pigeons?
You’ll not come to the Bon Marché? Good-by,
then!” And she would go tumbling down the stairs.
</p>

<p>
Phil painted a few studies from Helia. She posed for
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_94' name='Page_94' href='#Page_94'>94</a></span>
her portrait amid the flowers. Sometimes, in hours of
discouragement, when his work went badly and his future
seemed doubtful and the struggle became too painful,
Phil would dream as he looked at Helia.
</p>

<p>
“I will take her out of the life she is leading,” he
said to himself. “I’ve promised her! I will tear her
from her surroundings; I will make a cultivated woman
of her yet. It is God who has led her to cross my path.
I—I—”
</p>

<p>
And for a long time he would remain lost in thought.
</p>

<p>
In truth, it was a serious moment for him. Phil was
too young, too much left to himself, to be content for
any length of time with this simple rôle of friendship.
He was caught at his own game; and, seeing her day by
day more beautiful and good, it seemed to him that he
could no longer live without her.
</p>

<p>
What, then? Should he play with love, taking it for
a toy? Should he fashion her heart only to break it?
No! The blood which his veins inherited forbade him
such meanness. He would have despised himself as if
he had been the dust of Sodom.
</p>

<p>
Should he marry her, then?
</p>

<p>
“Helia is devotedness itself, tenderness, grace,” he
thought; “her poverty is the sister of my own: we are
equal. And yet, no! it is impossible, really! I cannot
marry Helia—a circus-girl!”
</p>

<p>
But this objection disappeared before the lofty, frank,
luminous look of Helia and the candor of her smile.
</p>

<p>
And still the days passed on. It was splendid weather.
Never had they so appreciated their little oasis, where
there was always some breeze while at their feet the city
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_95' name='Page_95' href='#Page_95'>95</a></span>
was stifling in the dull heat; though even they themselves
were sometimes almost overcome by it.
</p>

<p>
One afternoon Phil stuck up his canvas in the tool-shed
and stretched himself in the shade near Helia.
They talked of a thousand things or were silent for a
time, clasping each other’s hands. Suddenly Phil
jumped up.
</p>

<p>
“Let us go!” he said. “It is time. We never stayed
so late.”
</p>

<p>
But they found the door closed.
</p>

<p>
The guardian, no doubt, had glanced around the oasis,
and, seeing no one, had closed the door and gone down.
</p>

<p>
“He must have thought we had gone away,” said
Phil. “We are prisoners till to-morrow!”
</p>

<p>
“What an adventure!” said Helia. Both laughed
heartily.
</p>

<p>
Their supper was delightful. Poufaille would have
regretted there was no garlic or potatoes; but there were
strawberries, and two cakes which Phil had brought for
lunch, and good fresh water instead of wine. They had
never eaten better; it was as charming as child’s play.
Helia cut the fruits, dividing the oranges and arranging
the parts on leaves from the bushes. To drink, she
dipped the glass in a bucket of water at her side.
</p>

<p>
“Here, Phil, drink!” she said, as she offered him the
glass.
</p>

<p>
“You first!” answered Phil.
</p>

<p>
Helia touched her lips to the water, and Phil drank
off the glass.
</p>

<p>
“It’s better than champagne,” he said.
</p>

<p>
“Here, Phil, here’s a beautiful strawberry!”
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_96' name='Page_96' href='#Page_96'>96</a></span>
</p>

<p>
“Taste it first!” said Phil.
</p>

<p>
Helia put the berry between her lips, and Phil took it
from her with a kiss. The child’s play was growing
dangerous.
</p>

<p>
“<i>Marchons!</i> Now let’s take a walk!” said Phil.
</p>

<p>
“<i>C’est ça!</i> Let’s climb our Himalaya!” cried Helia.
</p>

<p>
This was the name they had given to the Pavilion
Sully, which lifts its enormous bulk between the Louvre
courtyard and the Cour du Carrousel. It was the culminating-point
of the roof. But the excursion was impossible
in full daylight; they would have been seen
from below; by night no one could see them.
</p>

<p>
They passed through their wilderness and, following
the roof on the other side, came to the foot of the <i>pavillon</i>.
There, in the shadow of a chimney as big as a tower,
iron steps had been placed along the dome from bottom
to top, and an iron rod at the side served as a hand-rail.
</p>

<p>
“<i>En route!</i>” said Phil.
</p>

<p>
The ascent, which was at first straight up, curved
little by little over the round dome; then there was
again a straight-up ascent along the crown of the
dome; and when this was passed they were at the top.
Helia followed without difficulty—it was nothing
for her.
</p>

<p>
They were on their Himalaya. To right and left
opened the abysses of the courtyards below, and on every
side the immense roofs with their humps and turrets
and projections stood out black as ebony against the
glow of Paris. Lights sparkled above and below—in
the heavens and from the city, which seemed another
heaven at their feet.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_97' name='Page_97' href='#Page_97'>97</a></span>
</p>

<p>
La Villette, the Trocadéro, Montrouge, and the Bastille
lighted up their constellations. The Champs-Élysées
stretched out like a comet. Montmartre shone palely
along the horizon like a far-off nebula; the great circle
of the boulevards belted the city with a Milky Way.
High up among the stars the Eiffel Tower lifted its
torch, like the pole-star.
</p>

<p>
“How grand it all is!” said Helia. She was on the
wide parapet, and her hair, loosened as she climbed up,
floated in the wind; her breast rose and fell as she caught
her breath again. A thousand broken lights came to
them where they stood amid the stars. You might have
said they were Youth and Love in the center of the
universe.
</p>

<p>
“How beautiful you are!” said Phil.
</p>

<p>
“Let us go down,” said Helia.
</p>

<p>
But as they climbed down there was a sudden cry.
A rusty step yielded under Phil’s weight, and, letting
go the hand-rail, he glided toward the abyss.
</p>

<p>
Without losing her head, with the rapidity and cool
decision of a trained acrobat, stretching out one arm
and holding hard with the other, and with her breast
flat against the wounding rungs, Helia by a mighty effort
grasped Phil’s wrist as he slid past her. The hand-rail
held firm, and Phil was saved. Then they came back
again to their oasis.
</p>

<p>
“Without you I should have been lost,” said Phil.
</p>

<p>
“Oh, no!” Helia answered, laughing bravely. “We
were almost down, close to the roof; you would have
had a slide, that’s all!”
</p>

<p>
Phil was moved to tears.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_98' name='Page_98' href='#Page_98'>98</a></span>
</p>

<p>
“Come, pull yourself together,” Helia said, “and
then to supper!”
</p>

<p>
She reached out her hand and took an apple gracefully
and offered it to Phil.
</p>

<p>
“Here, eat!”
</p>

<p>
Her simple gesture in offering him the apple had, to
Phil’s mind, something grandly Biblical in it, and the
idea overpowered him. As she held out her hand Phil
saw that it was bleeding, and exclaimed with anxiety.
</p>

<p>
“It is nothing,” she answered; “it was just now—perhaps
while I was holding on to the railing.”
</p>

<p>
With infinite respect he put his lips to the wound—and
suddenly he seemed to be drinking love at its
source; the fire ran through his veins; he seized Helia
with both arms and kissed her full on the mouth, crushing
his lips against hers!
</p>

<p>
“Helia, I love you! I love you, and you shall be my
wife!”
</p>

<p>
“Your wife! Alas, a poor girl like me! How can
you think of it, Phil?”
</p>

<p>
“And I will serve you on my knees!” said Phil.
</p>

<p>
He pressed Helia to his heart, and the girl wept for
joy. Phil drank the tears on her cheeks, and murmured
words of love—with Heaven as witness.

<h3>
CHAPTER VII
<br />
A RUDE AWAKENING
</h3>

<p>
Now followed a time of struggle and want; but
Phil supported his trials gaily, and gave the
same enthusiasm to his work which he had
given to his love.
</p>

<p>
At the school Phil was successful. The walls of his
room became covered with sketches,—life studies, landscapes,
compositions,—and more and more studies of
Helia, studies without end, all adorably graceful, and
showing at once the artist and the lover. All the phases
of their existence were there, from the little Saint John,
and the girl mending her <i>maillot</i> on the steps of the
circus-wagon, to the present Helia, the beautiful young
woman whom he had decided to make his companion
for life.
</p>

<p>
It was without fear that Phil felt this increase of
responsibility. It was even necessary that Helia should
use all her authority over him to persuade him to let her
go where her engagements called her. He was too poor
to pay her forfeits, and he consented. Soon Helia was
to go abroad. This would be the last time they should
separate; Phil swore it. When Helia should come back,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_100' name='Page_100' href='#Page_100'>100</a></span>
it would be for always. And what a woman he would
make of her! Helia should be his masterpiece.
</p>

<p>
The portrait he had painted from her would be worth
a Salon medal,—his master assured him so,—and that
would bring him out of his difficulties. Orders would
doubtless follow; but, while waiting, he would have to
live. Phil here and there sold a few little paintings.
Sometimes he had to run all over Paris to accomplish
this; but he told Helia where he was going, and they
would come back arm in arm like brother and sister,
while her smile scattered all his cares to the winds.
</p>

<p>
His troubles had their reward in great happiness.
There were vases full of flowers upon his table and
pretty curtains at his window; and, on his birthday,
Helia, with a bouquet, gave him a kiss into which she
put all the friendship and gratitude with which her
heart was filled.
</p>

<p>
There were also more substantial joys. They had
even as a supreme hope a chicken tied by the leg in a
corner of the room. They had intended fattening it.
Helia dreamed of a banquet to which she would invite
Poufaille and Suzanne; but the chicken was not ready.
The banquet was put off, and the day now came when
Helia was to go away.
</p>

<p>
Phil experienced the sadness of farewells at a railway
station on the crowded platform; there was the grasping
of hands, the promises to write, and the anguish of seeing
the train disappear in the night.
</p>

<p>
He came back overcome with grief. For the first
time the poverty of his room overwhelmed him; the
paper falling from the walls, his sketches fading upon
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_101' name='Page_101' href='#Page_101'>101</a></span>
them, all was somber and desolate in spite of the flowers
on the table and the curtains at the window.
</p>

<p>
He had never noticed it before, for Helia’s presence
had absorbed him wholly. Now he realized that he was
living in an attic and he blushed at his poverty.
</p>

<p>
Was he to fritter away his life in this way? How
could he—man that he was—endure this? With all his
desire he had not been able to keep in Paris the young
girl he loved—to tear her from her wandering life and
marry her. He, so free and strong, could not rid himself
of these bonds of poverty? He swore that he would be
free even though he should kill himself with work.

<h3>
CHAPTER VIII
<br />
THE END OF THE GUITAR
</h3>

<p>
One effort and then another, and little by little
Phil freed himself. So far his health could
stand it. He had glimpses of better days. Along
with his will his talent also grew strong. His progress
was rapid; step by step he mounted upward; and the
horizon grew wider before him.
</p>

<p>
The day when it was certain that Phil would have his
Salon medal, Socrate drank off his absinthe savagely
and declared:
</p>

<p>
“That fellow is lost!”
</p>

<p>
In a few words he put the case before the comrades.
</p>

<p>
Phil, the Phil they had known as such a “seeker,”
with so much personality, was knuckling down! He
was turning bourgeois—he was going to have his medal!
In other words, he was down on his knees to tickle the
soles of the feet of the old bonzes of the Academy!
</p>

<p>
“That’s no artist! not what I call an artist!” Socrate
went on. And it was plain from the fashion in which
Socrate ordered another absinthe that he, at least, would
never come to terms! Good old Poufaille was dumb
with admiration.
</p>

<p>
“What a pity Phil’s not here!” he thought.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_103' name='Page_103' href='#Page_103'>103</a></span>
</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_105' name='Page_105' href='#Page_105'>105</a></span>
</p>

<p>
A few days later he ran across Phil, who looked tired.
</p>

<p>
“You’re lost, you know; you’re in a bad way!” Poufaille
said to him as soon as he saw him; and he added
mysteriously: “You ought to go to see Socrate—such a
wonderful man, <i>mon cher</i>!”
</p>

<p>
“Come on,” answered Phil, who wanted a walk.
</p>

<p>
They found Socrate at the café, smoking his pipe and
talking art. Half hidden in a cloud of smoke, he raised
his head and looked at Phil.
</p>

<p>
“You’re doing things that please. Look out—take
care! You ought to do powerful things! Take any
subject at all—a bottle, a pumpkin, if you wish! it
doesn’t matter—only put your soul into it!”
</p>

<p>
“Put my soul into a bottle!” said Phil, amused.
</p>

<p>
Socrate did not admit any discussion of his pronouncements,
and struck Phil dumb with a glance.
</p>

<p>
“I tell you, you must paint with your soul!”
</p>

<p>
“But I always do my best!” Phil said.
</p>

<p>
“<i>Peuh!</i> your best!” Socrate had an expression of
unspeakable pity for Phil’s best.
</p>

<p>
Caracal now and then put in a brief appearance at the
Deux Magots, looking from Phil to Socrate and laughing
to himself.
</p>

<p>
“Socrate is right; you ought to do high art! It would
be very funny—you who are lucky enough to be the
lover—”
</p>

<p>
“What?” cried Phil.
</p>

<p>
“—of an acrobat! There’s inspiration for you! The
trapeze is high art; it soars—very high!”
</p>

<p>
“Another word and I’ll knock you down!” was Phil’s
answer.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_106' name='Page_106' href='#Page_106'>106</a></span>
</p>

<p>
“Calm yourself, <i>mon cher</i>! calm yourself!”
</p>

<p>
But Phil meanwhile was changing visibly. The life he
had been leading for some time had worn him out. He
now worked less and less, and came more and more
under the influence of Socrate. He expended his energy
at the café, and in his turn traced out masterpieces on
the table. He explained his ideas to Socrate, and discussed
them until the landlord turned out the gas and
wiped off the masterpieces with his napkin.
</p>

<p>
“Phil will go far!” Socrate said as he clapped him
on the shoulder, adding like a truly superior man:
</p>

<p>
“You haven’t twenty francs about you?”
</p>

<p>
One day Socrate brought with him, wrapped up in
a newspaper, an object which he laid on the bench.
</p>

<p>
“My guitar,” he said.
</p>

<p>
Socrate’s guitar! Every one was acquainted with it.
Socrate, painter-poet-philosopher, was a musician as
well. He “heard colors” and “saw sounds.” He had
undertaken a gigantic work—to set the Louvre to music
and make colors perceptible to the ear.
</p>

<p>
He took notes on the spot, colored photographs, and
then came home and played them on his guitar with the
hand of a genius. Violet was <i>si</i>; he made sol out of
blue; green was a <i>fa</i>—and so on up to red, which was
<i>do</i>.
</p>

<p>
Phil looked at the guitar with respect; and Socrate
had an idea.
</p>

<p>
“<i>Tiens!</i>” he said with a noble air; “take my guitar.
It has sounded the ‘Mona Lisa’—it has played Rubens
and Raphael! It has thrilled with beauty; it contains
the Louvre! My soul has vibrated within it! Do a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_107' name='Page_107' href='#Page_107'>107</a></span>
masterpiece with it! Show on your canvas all that it
holds! Take it! Carry it away with you!”
</p>

<p>
And Phil had taken away the guitar.
</p>

<p>
“All right,” he said the next day, “I will do a masterpiece.
They shall see if I am an artist or a pork-packer.”
</p>

<p>
He resolved to “hatch a masterpiece” from this guitar
which had thrilled with the soul of Socrate. From that
time he went out no longer. He passed whole days in
his room, distracted only by the cackling of the chicken
in its corner, that brought him back to the realities of
life.
</p>

<p>
“Ah, ha! You’re hungry, are you?” he said, as he
threw the chicken some crumbs. Then he looked at the
guitar as if he would say: “We’ll have it out together!”
</p>

<p>
Phil struggled. He dreamed and pondered, and
hunted all sorts of material for his sketches. He went
to the Louvre to study pictures that had guitars in them.
</p>

<p>
“The old masters knew nothing about guitars,” Phil
said one evening at the café. Even the comrades laughed
at this.
</p>

<p>
“How’s the guitar? Does it go?” they asked him.
</p>

<p>
They spoke only of guitars—guitar this and guitar
that—as if all the <i>estudiantinas</i> of all the Spains had
met together at the Deux Magots.
</p>

<p>
“It will drive me crazy!” said Phil.
</p>

<p>
“You will produce a masterpiece,” replied Socrate.
</p>

<p>
One evening Phil came in radiant. “I have it!” he
cried.
</p>

<p>
He explained his idea. Women had been painted in
the moonlight, in the sunlight, and in the light of flames.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_108' name='Page_108' href='#Page_108'>108</a></span>
<i>Eh bien!</i> he, Phil, would light his woman with reflections
from a guitar!
</p>

<p>
“You see, I have a woman’s head in shadow,” Phil
explained to Socrate, as he made lines with his pencil
on the table; “and the guitar itself is lighted up by a
ray from heaven—do you understand? Music, an echo
of heaven, enlightens our sad humanity!”
</p>

<p>
“Bravo!” exclaimed Socrate.
</p>

<p>
Poufaille, in his emotion, pressed Phil’s hand.
</p>

<p>
“I’ll give you a write-up!” said Caracal; “something
really good.” But he added to himself: “So you’re
painting echoes from heaven, pork-packer that you
are!”
</p>

<p>
Phil, under the guidance of Socrate, began his picture.
It was hard to set himself again to real work after so
many months of doing nothing. He exhausted his
strength and spirits over his canvas. He ate next to
nothing and grew thin visibly; he lived merely a life of
the brain.
</p>

<p>
“Oh, if I could only have a great success and get
rich,” he said to himself, “I would have Helia come
back!”
</p>

<p>
He wrote long letters to her. Helia’s replies breathed
love and the lofty confidence she had in him. At the
bottom of the page there was always a circle traced with
a pen, and to this he touched his lips.
</p>

<p>
It was Helia whom he was painting in the background
of his picture—a Helia illuminated by a strange light
like a vision.
</p>

<p>
But Phil, worn out and bloodless, no longer had the
strength to fix her features on canvas. He was all the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_109' name='Page_109' href='#Page_109'>109</a></span>
time beginning over again, floundering in his powerlessness.
</p>

<p>
Every now and then Socrate came to see him and
borrowed his last piece of money: “You haven’t five
francs about you?—and this old overcoat, lend it to me
till to-morrow!
</p>

<p>
“<i>Tiens!</i> a chicken!” Socrate went on, continuing his
inspection; and he winked at Phil and made a gesture
of wringing the fowl’s neck—“like that! <i>couïc!</i>” Then
he looked at the picture.
</p>

<p>
“It doesn’t go,” Socrate said, rubbing his hands.
</p>

<p>
At other times the picture seemed to go better.
</p>

<p>
“Look out! You’re going too fast!” Socrate said,
in a fright at the idea that his guitar might be brought
back to him and that he might no longer have a pretext
to come and borrow five francs or an overcoat. Suzanne
also paid Phil visits. He often spoke to her of Helia.
</p>

<p>
“You’re always thinking about her!” Suzanne said,
as she lighted a cigarette, taking two or three puffs and
throwing it away with a <i>pouah</i>!
</p>

<p>
“Well, you must be in love with Helia!” she continued.
“I had no idea of it! It won’t last, <i>mon cher</i>!”
</p>

<p>
She looked at him with mocking eyes.
</p>

<p>
“What do you mean by that?” Phil asked.
</p>

<p>
“Oh, I don’t mean to offend you, Monsieur Phil. I
believe you’re sincere!”
</p>

<p>
“You think I’m sincere!”
</p>

<p>
“My dear Phil, I’ve seen men dragging themselves
at my knees,—do you hear? dragging themselves at my
knees with tears in their eyes,—men who wouldn’t look
at me now!”
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_110' name='Page_110' href='#Page_110'>110</a></span>
</p>

<p>
“I’m not that kind,” said Phil.
</p>

<p>
“So much the better!” said Suzanne, becoming suddenly
grave. “I’m happy for Helia’s sake—very
happy, because she thinks so, too!”
</p>

<p>
Phil took up his palette; but Suzanne could not stay
quiet.
</p>

<p>
“Say, Monsieur Phil, how good you are, all the same!”
</p>

<p>
“I? Why?”
</p>

<p>
“You don’t see they’re making fun of you?”
</p>

<p>
“Who?”
</p>

<p>
“Why, Caracal’s set—Socrate among the rest,” Suzanne
answered.
</p>

<p>
“I don’t believe it,” Phil said. “Socrate is an enthusiast,
but he’s a real artist!”
</p>

<p>
“<i>Penses-tu, bébé!</i>” Suzanne murmured to herself.
Then, passing before the glass, with a twist of her finger
she put a lock of hair in place and went out.
</p>

<p>
Phil seldom had such visits. For the most part of
the time he was alone in front of his picture which did
not go. There was no end to his fumbling efforts. There
were always parts to be done over—and he never succeeded
in doing them right.
</p>

<p>
Socrate arrived one fine evening with his hands in his
pockets.
</p>

<p>
“I’m coming to live with you!” he said. “Landlords
are idiots, on my word! Talent and thought never
count with them. It’s dough they want. If it weren’t
for you I’d have to sleep out of doors!”
</p>

<p>
He sat down on a chair and added: “You’re willing?”
</p>

<p>
“Certainly,” Phil said, as he drew a mattress near the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_111' name='Page_111' href='#Page_111'>111</a></span>
stove. “You can sleep there for the present. We’ll see
later on.”
</p>

<p>
From that day an infernal life began for Phil. Socrate,
stretched out by the stove, worried him with advice
and made him begin the same thing twenty times over;
he encumbered the room, smoking like a locomotive or
sleeping until noon. When the thinker’s ferocious
snoring quite deafened Phil, he would whistle gently to
stop it. But a steamer’s siren would not have awakened
Socrate. Then Phil, in his exasperation, would shake
him by the shoulder.
</p>

<p>
“Let me be! I am thinking of something—hum—something,”
Socrate would stammer; and the sleeper
would begin “thinking” again. It was a continual torture.
Phil, moreover, was so weak that he could not even
get angry.
</p>

<p>
One morning Suzanne came in with her arms loaded
down with mistletoe and packages. “My friends, to-morrow
is Christmas day,” she said, as she entered.
</p>

<p>
“Ah!” Phil answered.
</p>

<p>
“What—ah?” Suzanne took him up. “Didn’t you
know it, then?”
</p>

<p>
“No,” said Phil, who was now only a shadow of himself,
living on mechanically from day to day.
</p>

<p>
“But didn’t you see,” asked Suzanne, “this pretty
Christmas card that Helia sent you from London?”
</p>

<p>
“Ah, yes!” said Phil; “true!”
</p>

<p>
“Phil is sick,” thought Suzanne, “and very sick!
He’s losing his memory. It’s high time that Helia
came back!”
</p>

<p>
“Let me prepare the feast,” she said next day.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_112' name='Page_112' href='#Page_112'>112</a></span>
“You’ll see what it will be! Men don’t understand
such things! Phil, let me do it, will you? I’ve invited
Poufaille. We shall be four at table. There is a fork
for each of us!”
</p>

<p>
“I don’t eat much,” Phil answered.
</p>

<p>
“Socrate will eat for you, Monsieur Phil,” said Suzanne.
She added: “I have a favor to ask you first: I
don’t want you to kill the chicken!”
</p>

<p>
“But we shall have nothing else for the meal,” said
Phil.
</p>

<p>
“Oh, Monsieur Phil, let her live! She’s so amusing!
She would follow me in the street, and people would take
her for a dog. But wouldn’t they laugh!”
</p>

<p>
“What a child you are!” Phil said.
</p>

<p>
“And then I’ll like you so much for it, and I’ll make
you a nice salad,” Suzanne went on, “and I’ll get
four sous’ worth of fried potatoes.”
</p>

<p>
“Granted!”
</p>

<p>
Just then they heard a <i>couïc</i>, and Socrate threw the
chicken with its neck wrung at the feet of Suzanne.
</p>

<p>
“Enough sentimentality,” he said.
</p>

<p>
Seeing the turn things were taking, Socrate, who was
not willing to miss his meal, had slyly stretched out his
hand, seized the chicken, and put an end to it.
</p>

<p>
“Oh, you wretch!” cried Suzanne.
</p>

<p>
“Bah! the chicken had to end by being eaten,” Phil
said; “let’s not quarrel for that!”
</p>

<p>
Suzanne made everything ready. She cleared the
table of paints and palette, spread the cloth and dishes
deftly, and sang as she did the cooking. Poufaille came
in, bringing a cheese made of goat’s milk and garlic
which he had received that morning from his village.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_113' name='Page_113' href='#Page_113'>113</a></span>

</p>

<p>
“What smells like that? <i>Pouah!</i>” Suzanne cried.
</p>

<p>
“Do you mean my cheese?” said Poufaille, in a
pet.
</p>

<p>
The time had come. With emotion Suzanne placed the
chicken on the table.
</p>

<p>
“Your chicken isn’t cooked; you’re not much on
cooking!” cried Poufaille, who had not forgiven the
insult to his cheese.
</p>

<p>
“I don’t know how to cook, don’t I?” Suzanne exclaimed;
“and I don’t understand salads, either? No,
perhaps, <i>hein!</i>”
</p>

<p>
Socrate, with his nose in his plate, ate like an ogre,
disdainful of idle quarrels.
</p>

<p>
“The salad?” Phil said, to keep up the gaiety.
“Your salad has a little too much vinegar.”
</p>

<p>
“My salad spoiled—oh, insolents! It’s worth while
taking trouble to please you!” And Suzanne began
weeping, or a pretense of weeping. But, suddenly losing
her temper, she seized the frying-pan with a “<i>Tiens!
tiens, donc! et aïe donc!</i> This will teach you!” and
while chicken and salad flew across the floor, bang! she
threw the pan full tilt into the painted guitar. Phil’s
picture was rent in twain.
</p>

<p>
“Oh, forgive me!” Suzanne cried.
</p>

<p>
All had passed as quick as lightning. Suzanne was at
Phil’s knees, weeping, begging pardon—oh! how could
she have done it, she who knew all the trouble he had
taken? And she kept on repeating in her despair: “Oh,
Phil, forgive me!”
</p>

<p>
Phil said not a word; he was pale as death. Poufaille
had fallen backward, and, sitting on his cheese, which
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_116' name='Page_116' href='#Page_116'>116</a></span>
had fallen under him, looked in turn at Phil and Suzanne.
Socrate was thunderstruck.
</p>

<p>
“Oh, forgive me, Phil, forgive me!” Suzanne went
on repeating.
</p>

<p>
But she did not finish. To her terror, she saw Phil
arise, turn, and fall headlong.

<h3>
CHAPTER IX
<br />
ALAS! POOR HELIA!
</h3>

<p>
Phil had been struck down by a rush of blood to
the brain. For a long time he had been living as
in a dream. His fits of absent-mindedness had already
amazed Suzanne. Too artificial a life, constant exasperation,
his fierce persistence at work which was beyond
his present strength, and the ravages of a fixed idea
had prepared him for brain-fever. The ruin of his
guitar picture was the last blow.
</p>

<p>
Suzanne quickly drove Socrate out of the room, and
took the mattress which was lying on the floor and put
it back in its place. She hastily made the bed, and then,
with the help of Poufaille, placed Phil on it. He was
still without motion, pale and bloodless, like a dead
man.
</p>

<p>
Suzanne ran to the Charité Hôpital. She was acquainted
with some of the young hospital doctors, and
she explained the case as well as she could. One of
them followed her to Phil’s studio and made a long examination
of him. As soon as he entered the disordered
room with its tale of want, the young doctor understood
all; he had already cared for victims like this of the
ideal.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_118' name='Page_118' href='#Page_118'>118</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Phil came back to life and moaned feebly.
</p>

<p>
“He is not dead!” Suzanne said.
</p>

<p>
“People don’t die like that!” the doctor replied, continuing
his examination. “Tell me how it happened.”
</p>

<p>
Suzanne told the doctor everything.
</p>

<p>
“It is as I thought,” he said. “We’ll pull him out
of it. But, first of all, take away all those canvases—put
the room in order; and those portraits of a young
girl, always the same one, there along the wall—take
them all away! You must deliver him from that vision
when he comes back to himself!”
</p>

<p>
“But he can’t live without her,” Suzanne said.
</p>

<p>
The doctor smiled sadly.
</p>

<p>
“If he only remembers her!” he murmured. “No
lesion; long overdoing followed by anemia, too strong
emotion, and doubtless some fixed idea,” the young doctor
rambled on as he looked at the portraits of Helia
which Poufaille was taking down. “It’s a kind of
intoxication of the nervous system—a railway brain, as
it were; we’ll give him things to build him up, and rest
and silence in the meantime.”
</p>

<p>
“Doc—doctor!” Poufaille stammered, livid with fear,
“is the disease catching?”
</p>

<p>
“No fear!” the doctor answered, as he glanced at the
hairy face of Poufaille, with its crimson health. “It
only comes from exaggerated intellectual functions.”
</p>

<p>
“Oh, I’m better already!” said Poufaille, reassured.
</p>

<p>
Phil was delirious for a week.
</p>

<p>
His mind, sunk in abysses of sleep, made obscure efforts
to come back to the light of day. Sometimes an
ocean of forgetfulness rolled him in its waves. Sometimes
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_119' name='Page_119' href='#Page_119'>119</a></span>
great flashes of light illuminated his consciousness
in its least details and gave to his dreams the hard relief
of marble.
</p>

<p>
Oftenest he simply wandered, mingling Helia and
Suzanne, seeing in his nightmare guitars, yellow on one
side and blue on the other, like worlds lighted up at once
by sun and moon—a whole skyful of guitars, amid
which, motionless, the skull of the poet-painter-sculptor-musician
thought constantly, never sleeping—until the
thought burned like a red-hot iron, and then Phil put his
hand to his own burning forehead and asked for something
to drink.
</p>

<p>
But there was some one to anticipate his wish. A
gentle hand raised his head on the pillow and an anxious
face bent over him, seeking to read his eyes, now
dulled, and now brilliant with the light of fever.
</p>

<p>
“Is it Helia?” Phil asked.
</p>

<p>
“It is I!” Helia answered. “Don’t speak—rest!
You must rest!”
</p>

<p>
Yes, Helia had come back. Suzanne, in her belief
that Phil was on the point of dying, had not been able
to resist the impulse to write to her. It did not occur
to Helia to ask if the disease was catching. She gave up
everything. She paid her forfeit, took her leave of absence,
her own good money going to pay another attraction
as a substitute. Nearly all her savings went in this
way—but she heeded it not. Nothing in the world would
have held her back. She had to be with Phil. She alone
had the right to tend him. Another with her own betrothed
in time of danger? No!
</p>

<p>
Helia nursed him night and day. Suzanne helped
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_120' name='Page_120' href='#Page_120'>120</a></span>
her, and Poufaille did the errands, going for food to
Mère Michel’s and for scuttles of coal to the <i>charbonnier</i>.
From morning to night his heavy shoes shook the staircase.
</p>

<p>
“Why don’t you give him wine?” he said, as he
looked at the sick man.
</p>

<p>
“Why not goat’s-milk cheese?” retorted Suzanne.
“Will you keep silence, <i>grand nigaud</i>? Go and get
some wood!”
</p>

<p>
“And the money to buy it with?”
</p>

<p>
“Here!” Helia said.
</p>

<p>
With what joy Helia watched Phil’s progress toward
health!
</p>

<p>
“Dear, dear friend, my little Saint John,” Phil said
to her. “How can I ever thank you for all you are
doing for me!”
</p>

<p>
He kissed her hand or put it to his burning forehead.
Once he rose up and looked around the room saying:
“Who is there?”
</p>

<p>
“It is I—Helia!”
</p>

<p>
“Who is Helia?”
</p>

<p>
“Helia, your friend—your Helia; I am here with Suzanne!”
</p>

<p>
“Out, wretches!” And he fell back exhausted.
</p>

<p>
“Leave him alone,” said the young doctor. “In a
fortnight he will be on his feet and I’ll send him to
the country.”
</p>

<p>
Helia, who was forced to depart, went away. Her
leave was over. Besides, she had no more money. Phil
grew better and better. At first he was surprised to find
his room so changed.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_121' name='Page_121' href='#Page_121'>121</a></span>
</p>

<p>
“Where are my pictures?” he asked. “What have
you done with them?”
</p>

<p>
“We’ve put them one side—you can see them later,”
answered Suzanne.
</p>

<p>
“What were they about?” inquired Phil. “Anyway,
it’s all the same to me!”
</p>

<p>
The young doctor, with the good-fellowship that binds
students together, accompanied him to a public sanatorium
not far from Paris. From that moment Phil
changed visibly. He who had been so anemic in the
vitiated atmosphere of his studio, with his nose always
over his oils and colors, and his eyes fixed on the canvas,
in Socrate’s company, had now abundance of pure air
and walks through the open fields. He felt himself
reborn, although his head was a little empty and his
body stiff and sore like one just taken from the torture-rack.
But good food and quiet did wonders for him.
He had an excellent constitution, made for work and
struggle, and it came up again.
</p>

<p>
With a beefsteak an idea would arrive; and with a
glass of wine joy entered his heart. His blood, renewed,
gave him new feelings. He had again become a man,
after the illness in which his youth had been shipwrecked.
</p>

<p>
Helia, anxious to see him, came back one day. How
difficult it had been for her—slave to her profession as
she was, and still bound to it for many months! Never
mind—she came! Phil was better, Phil was cured. She
would have his first smile; he would be her Phil in health
as in sickness. But at the gate of the sanatorium a magnificent
guardian, adorned with brass buttons and a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_122' name='Page_122' href='#Page_122'>122</a></span>
gilt-banded cap, stopped her. It was society closing its
doors to the intrusion of vagabonds. This man of law
and order asked Helia why, how, in whose name, by what
right, she wished to see Phil, and he refused the favor to
her, the mountebank who—had one ever seen the like?—pretended
to be his betrothed!
</p>

<p class="p2">
Phil came back to Paris cured. Strength and the
daring of courage returned with him. His long rest
seemed to have increased his energy tenfold. He went
forth from his past as one escapes from a prison, without
even looking backward. The young doctor had guessed
only too truly: Phil had forgotten many things!
</p>

<p>
Phil, who had received some unexpected money from
his uncle in Virginia, now changed his <i>quartier</i>, and set
himself up in better style; and the Salon medal gave
him his start. His professor made him acquainted with
the Duke of Morgania, who ordered from him the great
decorative picture of Morgana. The Comtesse de Donjeon
asked his aid for her charity sale.
</p>

<p>
One effort and then another, and this time Phil would
reach the goal. He had one of those happy dispositions
which attract luck as the magnet attracts iron filings.
He was ready; life was open before him like slack water
at sea; there was only wanting to him a good breeze to
swell his sail.
</p>

<p>
From what side was it to blow?

<h3>
CHAPTER X
<br />
MISS ETHEL ROWRER OF CHICAGO
</h3>

<p>
The breeze blew from the West.
</p>

<p>
Miss Ethel Rowrer, daughter of the great Redmount
Rowrer, had just arrived in Paris. She
was preceded by the fame of her father, the famous Chicagoan,
a business Napoleon. From his office, the center
of a network of telegraph and telephone lines, he communicated
with the financial universe; and his tremendous
toil was building up a world-wide fortune. He
thought himself poor, for he had not yet reached the
billion mark; but his fame grew. Ethel adored this
father. She was proud that men spoke of him. She
felt herself a part in his glory; but, really, she could
have wished people should pay less attention to herself.
Every day the society papers devoted space to her.
</p>

<p>
“Yesterday evening, Miss Ethel Rowrer, daughter of
the famous <i>milliardaire</i>, was present at the opera”—and
so forth; and there followed a description of her dress.
</p>

<p>
“To-morrow, Miss Ethel Rowrer, daughter of the famous
<i>milliardaire</i>, accompanied by her grandmother,
will be present at the horse show.”
</p>

<p>
They told how she passed her day; people learned that
she had tried on gowns at Paquin’s, chosen a hat at
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_126' name='Page_126' href='#Page_126'>126</a></span>
Stagg’s, eaten chocolates at Marquis’s—while in reality
she had stayed at home with “grandma.”
</p>

<p>
All this gossip annoyed her. One day, however, she
laughed heartily. She learned from a paper her intention
of buying the tomb of Richard the Lion-hearted to
make a bench of it in her hall at Chicago. This earned
for Ethel a newspaper article, grave and patriotic.
</p>

<p>
“Foreigners, touch not our illustrious dead!” was the
journalist’s conclusion in the evening “Tocsin.”
</p>

<p>
Richard the Lion-hearted went the rounds of the head-lines
of the Paris yellow press. Then, one fine day, the
papers spoke of an interview of the ex-Empress Eugénie
with Miss Ethel Rowrer, daughter of the famous <i>milliardaire</i>,
R. K. Rowrer. Vieillecloche, in his “Tocsin,”
had seen and heard everything. He accused America
of mixing itself up with French politics. Miss Ethel
did not read the article, otherwise she might have gathered
that the “Tocsin” was very ill-informed. That
she had seen the empress was true, but there had been
no word of politics.
</p>

<p>
The empress was making a short stay in Paris, as she
did every year. Her sorrows had given the former sovereign
the love of retirement. She passed her days by
her window at the hotel, sometimes looking sadly toward
the empty place where the Tuileries had been.
</p>

<p>
“I see by the paper that Miss Ethel Rowrer is in
Paris,” the empress said one day to her <i>dame de compagnie</i>.
“Is it the granddaughter of the Rowrer I
knew? The emperor had great esteem for him; I remember
him well. Mr. Rowrer was charged by the government
at Washington with a report on the Exposition
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_127' name='Page_127' href='#Page_127'>127</a></span>
of 1867. My husband loved to look into everything
himself. Social questions were near to his heart, and it
happened that in the evenings he would receive Mr.
Rowrer in his private cabinet. The extreme simplicity
and moral robustness of the man struck the emperor.
He found him full of new ideas which he would have
wished to apply in France. I was present at one
of their conversations. My little son was playing
around them. <i>Ma chère ami</i>,” Eugénie continued, “I
remember it as if it were yesterday. I beg of you to find
out if Miss Rowrer is the granddaughter of that man.”
The next day she learned that this was the fact.
</p>

<p>
“I should have been astonished if it were not so,”
said Eugénie. “The emperor foresaw the success of
Mr. Rowrer; he knew men.” She at once made known
to Miss Rowrer that she would be happy to receive her;
and Ethel came. Entering, she saw but one thing: in
an arm-chair by the window a lady, with her head
covered by a black mantilla, sat in the clear sunlight
like a dark figure of sorrow.
</p>

<p>
“Madame,” said the lady in waiting, “I present to
you Miss Ethel Rowrer.”
</p>

<p>
Ethel saw the dark figure rise from the chair.
</p>

<p>
“Thank you for coming!” Eugénie said. “I am glad
when people come to see me,” and she held out her hand.
</p>

<p>
Ethel bore the hand to her lips and bowed with a grace
which charmed Eugénie.
</p>

<p>
“Be seated, Miss Rowrer,” said the empress; “here,
beside me,” and she pointed with the slender hand of
an aged woman to a seat.
</p>

<p>
Ethel sat down. She was in the presence of Eugénie
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_128' name='Page_128' href='#Page_128'>128</a></span>
de Guzman and Porto-Carrero, Countess of Teba, Marquise
of Mopa and Kirkpatrick, Empress of the French—Eugénie
the beautiful, the beloved; and it was an old
lady warming herself in the sun and looking around
timidly.
</p>

<p>
“How happy I am, madame,” said Ethel, “to thank
you for the kindnesses shown long ago to my grandfather!
His Majesty the Emperor loaded him with
favors.”
</p>

<p>
The empress was greatly touched by the sincere accents
of Ethel and her faithful remembrance. No one
thanked her, now that she was nothing; and this daughter
of a <i>milliardaire</i> had not forgotten slight kindnesses
done long ago to her grandfather.
</p>

<p>
“I thank you,” she said. “The emperor had great
esteem for your grandfather; he liked to talk with him.
Mr. Rowrer was a remarkable man—rather, he was a
man!” added the empress, who had seen so many who
were not men.
</p>

<p>
Ethel blushed with pleasure. Newspaper head-lines
constantly made sport of her family, and here was the
one-time arbitress of Europe glorifying her grandfather
and saying to her “I thank you!”
</p>

<p>
Then they chatted for a while. Eugénie admired this
young girl in her simple elegance and superb health. At
the court itself she had never seen a figure more princess-like
and radiant.
</p>

<p>
“When I was a little girl,” Ethel said, “my grandfather
often spoke to us of those days of glory.”
</p>

<p>
At the word “glory” Eugénie interrupted her.
</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<img src="images/i-143.jpg" width="356" height="550" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Miss Ethel and Empress Eugénie</p>
</div>

<p>
“Miss Rowrer,” she said, pointing with her hand
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_129' name='Page_129' href='#Page_129'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_130' name='Page_130' href='#Page_130'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_131' name='Page_131' href='#Page_131'>131</a></span>
toward the Tuileries, “see what remains of it. There
is nothing left. All has passed, all has changed around
me. This was once my Paris. It is now yours. I say
yours, for, don’t you see, mademoiselle, the true sovereigns
are young girls like you with their grace and
health? To you the world belongs. Ah, what happiness
it is to be young!”
</p>

<p>
There was a moment of silence. The <i>dame de compagnie</i>
was arranging flowers in a vase. The empress
sat dreaming. Did she see again the eighteen years of
power wherein she held in her hand the scepter of
France? Or the palace which had been destroyed,
crumbled into dust, leaving not a wrack behind? Did
she think of Miss Rowrer, to-day’s young queen, who
came to pay her tribute of respect to the royalty of other
days? of the conquering force which this young girl
represented, the supreme outcome of an ambitious race?
of the temptations without number which would assail
a creature so spoiled by fate?
</p>

<p>
Ethel made a motion to take her leave. The empress
rose painfully.
</p>

<p>
“Madame,” Ethel began.
</p>

<p>
“Allow me; I wish to accompany you,” Eugénie insisted.
“Your visit has done me good.”
</p>

<p>
She leaned lightly on Miss Rowrer’s shoulder as she
crossed the room.
</p>

<p>
“Miss Rowrer, I am going to tell you a great secret,”
said the empress, as she was taking leave; “but one must
have been an empress to appreciate it rightly. It is
this: remain always simple and artless as you were at
fifteen. That is the secret of happiness; there is no
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_132' name='Page_132' href='#Page_132'>132</a></span>
other, believe me! Adieu, mademoiselle. I wish you all
happiness in life.”
</p>

<p class="p2">
Ethel retained through life the vision of this woman
in her mourning garments, with the white hair crowning
her forehead. She recalled her gentle voice, her refined
features—still resembling the portraits of other days, but
without the adorable smile.
</p>

<p>
“Our people,” Ethel said to her grandmother, “interest
themselves only in Marie Antoinette and the Princesse
de Lamballe. I wish to make a collection concerning
the Empress Eugénie—photographs, statuettes. And
I will take back to Chicago her portrait in oils. I’ll
have it done here in Paris under my direction. Who is
this Phil who, they say, has so much talent, and has
painted so fine a portrait for the Salon—a young girl
seated among flowers with doves around her? Cecilia
Beaux admires it immensely. He has had a second
medal, I believe—he has everything he needs to succeed;
and he is an American, they say, and poor and ambitious.”
</p>

<p>
“He is poor and ambitious? Give him a chance,”
replied grandma.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_133' name='Page_133' href='#Page_133'>133</a></span>
</p>

</div>
<div class="chapter">

<h3>
CHAPTER XI
<br />
AN APARTMENT IN THE LATIN QUARTER
</h3>

<p>
Nothing remained for Ethel but to meet her artist.
An opportunity soon offered itself at the
Comtesse de Donjeon’s five-o’clock tea, at which
she was often present.
</p>

<p>
Ethel, first of all, had looked for an apartment for
her own convenience; the hotel, thanks to Vieillecloche,
was becoming intolerable.
</p>

<p>
“Foreigners, stay at home!” the “Tocsin” printed.
“Remember the night of the 13th March, 1871, of
the day of November 22, 1876. Respect the verdict
of the 363. Tremble! The people is bristling its mane of
the 16th May, and bares its claws of the 14th July!”
</p>

<p>
“We’d have done better to stay in Chicago,” said
grandma.
</p>

<p>
At first the torrent of carriages and automobiles and
bicycles flowing day and night before her window had
amused Ethel. But soon she tired of it. There were,
indeed, theaters and parks, and visits to dressmakers
and society calls. But the theaters were impossible, the
parks were only parks after all, the visits to dressmakers
were anything but amusing—it’s so easy to buy! and as
to society, Ethel wished to rest a little—for a change!
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_134' name='Page_134' href='#Page_134'>134</a></span>
</p>

<p>
“To speak four languages, including my own, to
play three instruments, including the harp, which only
needs passable arms—all that doesn’t count. I must
go to painting again. Oh, I wish I could have a picture
on the line and a Salon medal! I wish I could do a work
on La Salle’s explorations, at the Bibliothèque Nationale!
What would I not give to write like Princess
Troubetzkoi or paint like Cecilia Beaux! I am tired of
all this idleness. I wish to work; I wish to be something
by myself, and not merely the daughter of papa. I
wish that—Grandma! let’s go to the Latin Quarter! I
will be just a student girl living with her good grandmother
while she studies art!”
</p>

<p>
“Let’s go, then, to the Latin Quarter, Ethel,” said
grandma, who would have followed Ethel to the end of
the world. “We shall be as well off there as here—or
let’s go back to America if you wish; for my part I
prefer new countries!”
</p>

<p>
“But the Latin Quarter shall be new for you! You
shall see how we’ll amuse ourselves,” said Ethel, kissing
her grandmother.
</p>

<p>
So they looked for a place in the Latin Quarter. They
set off early, and, walking under the great trees of the
Luxembourg, or leaning on the balustrades, looked at
the palace and the flower-beds of the gardens.
</p>

<p>
There were bare-legged babies; nurses beribboned
from neck to heel; soldiers in red trousers; a priest in a
black gown; gardeners in wooden shoes; young girls
without hats; students with hats flat-brimmed; everything
gave them the feeling that they were abroad, far,
far away. Such specimens of the pigmy races which
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_135' name='Page_135' href='#Page_135'>135</a></span>
vegetate in old countries amused grandma, and the garden
pleased her greatly.
</p>

<p>
“This is like Douglas Park—except that it hasn’t
any ornamental mound. Do you remember, Ethel, that
globe of earth with continents and seas colored on it in
different flowers, and our glorious flag made of white
and red pinks and blue corn-flowers?”
</p>

<p>
“Oh, grandma, for heaven’s sake!” said Ethel.
</p>

<p>
“And yet it’s not bad here,” continued grandma.
“The people are so gay! the soldiers’ trousers are too
short, and the gardener has wooden shoes; but they look
gay; why, I wonder?”
</p>

<p>
At the beginning they did not venture into the Latin
Quarter without some emotion. On the strength of what
they had read and seen at the theater they expected
moss-grown houses with flowers in the windows, and
streets resounding with song, where students and grisettes
danced the <i>cancan</i>. Grandma soon got over her
mistake, after a narrow escape from being crushed by a
tram-car in a thoroughfare which was for all the world
like State Street.
</p>

<p>
“It’s not so bad as I thought,” she said enthusiastically.
“It reminds me of Chicago.”
</p>

<p>
In their visits they went up and down an endless
number of stairways. Often grandma stayed below,
leaving Ethel to visit the apartments.
</p>

<p>
“Houses without elevators!” said grandma; “Ethel
must be crazy!”
</p>

<p>
She waited for Ethel in deep courtyards or sat in
concierges’ lodges, near stoves where cabbage-soup was
bubbling. More than once, while she was alone in the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_136' name='Page_136' href='#Page_136'>136</a></span>
lodge, some one would come and ask information from
her, taking her for the concierge. Once a butcher’s boy,
with his basket of meat on his arm, opened the door.
</p>

<p>
“<i>B’jour</i>, m’am; what will M’am Gibbon have to-day—<i>culotte
de veau</i>?”
</p>

<p>
But he ran away in a fright at the sight of Mrs.
Rowrer staring at him without answering. Such incidents
helped grandma to pass the time.
</p>

<p>
It was while crossing the Rue Servandoni that they
at last found their apartment. An atmosphere of peace
seemed to issue forth from the old façade with its immense
windows. By the open door they could see a wide
stone staircase with a railing of wrought iron. A great
tree shaded the silent courtyard. The placard was out:
“Apartment to Let.” So they entered. The apartment
was at once magnificent and simple, all in white, with
lines of gold, and carved doors surmounted by painted
panels.
</p>

<p>
The street itself had a certain air of tranquil distinction.
One of its extremities seemed barred by the austere
walls of the old Luxembourg Palace, and the other by
the enormous apse of St. Sulpice, with its statue of St.
Paul upright on a pedestal between two columns.
</p>

<p>
“My favorite saint!” said Ethel, who did not believe
in cold and passionless perfection, but in struggles for
the best, with tears undoing faults. “St. Paul himself
keeps guard over the end of the street! How happy
we shall be here, grandma! And we’ll heat ourselves
with wood fires and be lighted with candles,” she added
with the joy of a child.
</p>

<p>
“We’ve found a real gem of an apartment,” Ethel
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_137' name='Page_137' href='#Page_137'>137</a></span>
said to the Comtesse de Donjeon, that very evening at
her “five”-o’clock, which was at four. “Imagine, madame,
a door covered with carving, through which you
go underneath Medusa heads and cornucopias. We shall
burn oil-lamps and candles; that will make us wish
to wear flounces and dress our hair <i>à la belle poule</i>—”
</p>

<p>
“And to play ‘<i>Il pleut, bergère</i>’ on a spinet!” the
countess interrupted. “Where did you discover such a
gem of an apartment!”
</p>

<p>
“In the Rue Servandoni,” said Ethel.
</p>

<p>
“I know,” said the countess; “it’s near St. Sulpice.
And, by the way, dear Miss Rowrer, if you wish any
bric-à-brac to furnish your shelves, I can recommend
you a precious man, a great connoisseur and a distinguished
critic, a journalist of the good cause—M. Caracal.”
</p>

<p>
“Thank you so much, madame! M. Caracal would
be very useful to me,” Miss Rowrer had answered.
</p>

<p>
“He’s a friend of the Duke of Morgania and of your
fellow-countryman, Mr. Phil Longwill, whom you are
acquainted with, perhaps.”
</p>

<p>
“Only by name,” Ethel said.
</p>

<p>
“The duke and Mr. Longwill are coming here to-day,
I believe. I will present them to you if you wish.”
</p>

<p>
They were in the great salon in the half-darkness of
the silken curtains. Although it was broad daylight
outside, lighted lamps shed a yellow glow and sparkled
amid the glass of the chandeliers and the gold frames
of paintings. A valet announced two ladies—“Mme.
and Mlle. de Grojean!” The countess hastened toward
them.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_138' name='Page_138' href='#Page_138'>138</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Ethel was looking vaguely into the depths of the
room. Two other visitors came in, talking together like
friends.
</p>

<p>
“His Highness the Duke of Morgania.
</p>

<p>
“Monsieur Phil Longwill!”
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_139' name='Page_139' href='#Page_139'>139</a></span>

<h3>
CHAPTER XII
<br />
ETHEL’S IDEA OF A MAN
</h3>

<p>
As a consequence of their meeting, Ethel became
Phil’s pupil. Having made his acquaintance at the
Comtesse de Donjeon’s, she gave him a “chance,”
as grandma had told her to do. She ordered from him
two pictures according to ideas of her own: first, Eugénie
young and beautiful, present in the emperor’s
cabinet at the reception of Rowrer, the grandfather;
then Miss Rowrer had him paint Eugénie aged and
broken, seated by the window and looking far away on
the empty Place of the Tuileries. Better and better
satisfied, she ordered from him grandma’s and her own
portrait. These orders were enough to “launch” Phil,
as they say, and brought him other orders from the
society frequented by Miss Rowrer.
</p>

<p>
Ethel, before she came to Phil, had been working in
the École des Beaux-Arts; but there the studio seemed
gloomy to her and she stifled in it. Moreover, she was
already rather tired of the Latin Quarter on account
of her fellow-countrymen whom she met there.
</p>

<p>
She had a grudge against some of them for imitating
and even exaggerating the most foolish faults of a certain
class of students. She did not approve their wearing
their hair like a horse’s mane, their velvet trousers
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_140' name='Page_140' href='#Page_140'>140</a></span>
and knit-woolen jackets, and their way of carrying
around with them boxes and brushes and canvases as if
they were sign-painters. And when she saw them seated
on the curbstone <i>terrasses</i> before cafés, drinking in public
and spitting everywhere and puffing the smoke of
their cigarettes into the faces of the passers-by, it exasperated
her. She had a desire to call out to them:
“Up! and go to work!”
</p>

<p>
As she did not like the art academies of the Quarter,
she decided for Phil’s studio. She had another reason
for doing this. The École des Beaux-Arts was too near,
and Ethel needed exercise. In spite of the enormous
distance to Phil’s studio, she always went to it on foot—“to
keep myself in training,” she said. She came back
the same way—to give herself an appetite. Thus every
morning she had four hours’ work and two hours’ walk—just
to keep “in shape.”
</p>

<p>
Ethel, one morning, was at the studio with Mlle.
Yvonne de Grojean. The model’s rest was over and
they were beginning work again. The concierge—the
old man “of my time” and former inspector of the
Louvre roofs—mounted the table and posed before the
girls dressed as a Louis Quinze marquis. There was a
pushing about of easels and chairs, palettes were taken
up, and at once the model was beset with remarks:
</p>

<p>
“Model—the head!”
</p>

<p>
“Model—the foot!”
</p>

<p>
“Model—smile!”
</p>

<p>
At this formal injunction the concierge bridled up,
distorted his eyes, twisted his lips, and swelled out his
neck like a goiter.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_141' name='Page_141' href='#Page_141'>141</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Ethel and Mlle. Yvonne were not working from the
Louis Quinze model. Helia posed for them in a corner
of the studio—the corner of “still life.” She happened
to be free that morning, as the figure of Morgana
which Phil was painting from her was nearly finished.
Helia had come down to the pupils’ studio to please
Ethel, who greatly desired to do a head of the Madonna
from her.
</p>

<p>
Ethel and Mlle. Yvonne chatted together as they
added touches to their water-colors. Ethel was relating
to her friend, Yvonne de Grojean, the visit she had paid
some time before to Phil’s private studio, where she had
seen the Duke of Morgania. She had also described the
magnificent decorative painting which Phil was finishing
for the duke.
</p>

<p>
Their conversation was punctuated here and there by
the remarks cried out around them to the Louis Quinze
marquis:
</p>

<p>
“Model—the eye!”
</p>

<p>
“Model—the mouth!”
</p>

<p>
“Really,” said Ethel, “that concierge is incorrigible.
Why does he persist in <i>not</i> looking like the students’
drawings?”
</p>

<p>
Mlle. de Grojean at Ethel’s side laughed heartily.
</p>

<p>
“How droll you are!”
</p>

<p>
Helia smiled in spite of herself.
</p>

<p>
“The papers keep me in good humor,” Ethel answered.
“I venture there’s something in them again
about Richard the Lion-hearted,” she continued, pointing
to a paper on the chair. “All sorts of bargains are
offered to me ever since that story—usually old mummies.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_142' name='Page_142' href='#Page_142'>142</a></span>
No; there is nothing about Richard to-day,”
Ethel remarked, as she ran through the head-lines. But
she received her “pin-prick” all the same. In an open
letter some one attacked American society and the lack
of solidity in its family ties—signed, “H. Ochsenmaulsalatsfabrikant.”
This annoyed Miss Rowrer more than
personal attack. She was amazed that people could have
such thoughts about her country.
</p>

<p>
“In your country,” was the conclusion of the Salatsfabrikant,
“the young men run after money and the
young women after titles.”
</p>

<p>
“Personally I had the idea that titles were running
after me,” thought Ethel, who had had reasons for believing
so during the three months in which the duke
had been paying her court.
</p>

<p>
She had already forgotten the open letter, but she
kept on thinking of the subject it had started up in her
mind.
</p>

<p>
Ah, certainly not! Titles were not to be her aim in
life. Most of all, since her visit to the empress, she had
promised herself to give worldly grandeurs only the esteem
they deserve. A title! A title no more takes from
a man’s qualities than it adds to them. The main thing
for a man is, not to be a duke or prince; it is, first and
foremost—to be a man!
</p>

<p>
Mlle. Yvonne was also painting a Madonna’s head
from Helia. She wished to make a medallion of it as a
present for her mother. Helia took pleasure in posing
for these girls who were so kind to her.
</p>

<p>
Ethel, after seeing Helia at Phil’s the day after the
Quat’z-Arts Ball, had met her several times, and felt a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_143' name='Page_143' href='#Page_143'>143</a></span>
very sincere sympathy for her. She seemed to her to be
“the right sort of girl.”
</p>

<p>
She had even proposed to send her to Chicago as a
professor of physical training in the Women’s University
founded by her father. The situation was brilliant,
her future would be assured, and she would probably
make a very good marriage before long. Helia thanked
her effusively—but something kept her in Paris; and
she added: “Paris alone gives the consecration to
artistes!”
</p>

<p>
Ethel knew that Helia was preparing a number which
was to make a sensation. Meanwhile, she had her little
sister, and, so it seemed, was paying for the old clown
Cemetery out of pure goodness of soul. For the time
being she was pinched for money. Ethel would have
been happy to do her a kindness; but she knew that
Helia would never accept anything under any form
whatsoever, not even a gift to Sœurette. A smile, yes!
a kind word, yes! an obligation, no!
</p>

<p>
It was the same with Suzanne, the model who sometimes
posed for pupils, and whose acquaintance Ethel
had also made. This simplicity of manners, which was
at the foundation of their race, touched Ethel. She
pardoned the “pigmies” many things for the sake of
these brave little hearts. An acrobat and a model—what
matters it? Character is everything!
</p>

<p>
“Model—time! Rest!”
</p>

<p>
There was a noise of palettes laid aside and pupils
rising in their places. The old marquis telescoped his
neck into his laces and came down from the table.
</p>

<p>
“You who are collecting mummies,” Yvonne de Grojean
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_144' name='Page_144' href='#Page_144'>144</a></span>
said, laughing, to Ethel, “you ought to add the
concierge; he is a type!”
</p>

<p>
“Don’t laugh, Yvonne,” said Ethel; “he would do
very well in our hall in Chicago; he’d give it an air of
the old régime; there are heaps of men like that in
princely anterooms.”
</p>

<p>
Painting was over and they were now talking in the
still-life corner. Of the other students some were walking
two by two, some were standing, and others seated
on the high stools; and some were grouped about Mlle.
Yvonne and Ethel, who was, in a way, their leader,
by the social position she held, and the prestige of her
name. All around her they conversed as in a parlor,
amusing themselves with a passing broil between the
English Miss Arabella and Mlle. Yvonne.
</p>

<p>
“England should not allow it!” Miss Arabella had
exclaimed, speaking of some performance of French
politics.
</p>

<p>
“French affairs concern us alone!” Mlle. Yvonne,
usually so timid, had retorted, as she raised her head
whereon her hair was rolled like a helmet.
</p>

<p>
Miss Rozenkrantz, a Swede with spectacles, made
peace, as if by chance, with her explanation of a new
association in Stockholm—the “Women’s Anti-Marriage
League.”
</p>

<p>
“What are its articles?” Miss Rowrer asked.
</p>

<p>
“Absolute indifference to men—woman by herself
in all and for all—meetings—lectures to girls—mutual
aid—unions.”
</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<a name="i-159" id="i-159"></a>
<img src="images/i-159.png" width="373" height="550" alt="" />
<p class="caption">“Ethel, who was their leader”</p>
</div>

<p>
Conversation followed in which the Anti-Marriage
League was discussed. On such subjects Mlle. Yvonne
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_145' name='Page_145' href='#Page_145'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_146' name='Page_146' href='#Page_146'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_147' name='Page_147' href='#Page_147'>147</a></span>
did not speak. She listened with astonishment to these
young women from the countries of the North talking
among themselves of things on which she never touched:
marriage and anti-marriage—leagues—clubs—of all this
she was ignorant.
</p>

<p>
Mlle. Yvonne was passing two months in Paris. It
was the Comtesse de Donjeon, a friend of the Grojean
family, who had introduced her to Miss Rowrer. The
two young women were unlike both in education and
ideas—and they at once became great friends. But
Mlle. Yvonne was shortly to return to her old tranquil,
provincial home, and she was enjoying her last weeks
in Paris. To-day, especially, she was delighted to hear
them talking freely before her, and, most of all, about
marriage. For her it was the escapade of a school-girl
looking over the wall at the fruits of a forbidden
garden.
</p>

<p>
One thing, however, was troubling her. Her mother
had not come back, as she always did, to take her home.
Doubtless there was some unforeseen hindrance. She
confided her disquiet to Ethel.
</p>

<p>
“Don’t worry; your mother will come. And even if
she does not, you can go away alone, I suppose.”
</p>

<p>
“What!” said Yvonne, “cross Paris all alone? You
wouldn’t think of it!”
</p>

<p>
“But I do it!”
</p>

<p>
“That is true,” Yvonne said, blushing.
</p>

<p>
They were speaking in a low tone; the others were
not listening, but surrounded Miss Rozenkrantz.
</p>

<p>
“What is more natural than to go about alone?”
Ethel said to Yvonne. “What harm is there, <i>voyons</i>?
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_148' name='Page_148' href='#Page_148'>148</a></span>
You slander your fellow-countrymen—the men of Paris
are not tigers, I imagine. What danger is there?”
</p>

<p>
“Oh, none,” Yvonne admitted; “but they are said to
be so gallant!”
</p>

<p>
“Gallant! An ill-bred fellow accosts you in the street
and you say he is gallant?”
</p>

<p>
“Not exactly, no,” Yvonne hastened to say; “it’s
just the contrary.”
</p>

<p>
“Men such as that,” said Ethel, “are not men—that’s
all!”
</p>

<p>
There was a moment of silence.
</p>

<p>
“Men who are not men—that must be another of
Miss Ethel’s pleasantries,” thought Yvonne.
</p>

<p>
Ethel looked at her water-color, throwing back her
shoulders to judge better of the effect. What she did
not understand was that a young woman like Yvonne
should accommodate herself to such a state of affairs—Yvonne,
who but now, during the squabble with Miss
Arabella, had the decided air of some Gaulish Amazon.
Why should she be so timid with regard to such insolent
dogs? She felt really a lofty and protecting pity for this
sister of an old country, nice as she was.
</p>

<p>
“Men such as that!” she began again, in a tone of
contempt.
</p>

<p>
“Such as what?” Yvonne timidly asked. “Do you
mean workmen, men with blouses—those of whom you
were just speaking—those who are not—”
</p>

<p>
“Who said anything like that?” replied Ethel.
“Dress has nothing to do with it.”
</p>

<p>
“It’s their profession, then?” Yvonne asked again;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_149' name='Page_149' href='#Page_149'>149</a></span>
“or is it nationality? The Englishman is different from
the Frenchman—the German—”
</p>

<p>
“Ochsenmaulsalatsfabrikant!” Ethel interrupted.
</p>

<p>
“All go to make up so many different types, I know,”
Mlle. Yvonne continued.
</p>

<p>
“It’s nothing of all that!” said Ethel, seriously.
“When I say <i>a man</i> I speak neither of an officer nor of
a lawyer nor of a doctor nor a workman nor a prince.
Rich or poor, German, English, or French—it doesn’t
matter!”
</p>

<p>
The students had gathered round. They asked one
another what Miss Rowrer meant—who, then, is the <i>rara
avis</i> that is neither this nor that—not a workman, not a
prince?
</p>

<p>
Helia kept silence and listened. Which man? She
had known one who seemed to her frank and loyal, and
gave her his word; and then—then he had forgotten it!
What meaning, then, was there in Miss Rowrer’s
words? But she understood perfectly, and she blushed
for Phil when Ethel, to signify those qualities of uprightness,
equity, and honor—that respect for one’s
word once given—which she meant by “man,” repeated
in a tone of deepest conviction:
</p>

<p>
“I say <span class="smcap">A MAN</span>!”

<h3>
CHAPTER I
<br />
WANTED—A DUCHESS!
</h3>

<p>
As he had himself said to Ethel the day of his visit
to Phil’s studio, Conrad di Tagliaferro, Duke of
Morgania, was much to be pitied—he had to
quit Paris!
</p>

<p>
The duke reveled in the life of the Boulevard, losing
himself amid the crowd, climbing to the tops of
omnibuses, taking a cab to the opera, getting himself
spoken of in the society news of the papers. He was
seen everywhere,—in salons and at the theater, at the
clubs and at the races. There was no ceremony for
him, and he had no cares. Arriving in Paris he put
aside all the duties of his position as you might leave
a coat in the cloak-room. When he accepted a friend’s
invitation he always insisted that there should be no
questions of etiquette.
</p>

<p>
“<i>Sans cérémonie</i>—it’s understood,” and he would
add in Parisian slang, “<i>au hazard de la fourchette</i>
[pot-luck]!”
</p>

<p>
However, there was a “but.” His people pestered him
from afar in the shape of two voivodes who had been
delegated by his nobles, and who followed him even
to his late suppers like some twofold Banquo specter.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_154' name='Page_154' href='#Page_154'>154</a></span>
These delegates were in Paris to urge his return.
The duke had been lucky enough to avoid them until
now; but their mere presence said clearly enough that
things were going wrong in Morgania.
</p>

<p>
Since the fabulous days of Morgana the unity of
this little warlike people had always been kept at its
frontier, beneath the shadow of its great red banner
with the white cross facing barbarism; and it was
from that side the storm was muttering once again.
</p>

<p>
There were grave reports from Macedonia. Houses
were being burned and convoys pillaged. All the villages
from Kassovo to Monastir were in ebullition.
Bands of bashi-bazouks had come as far as the Drina.
It would be necessary to go back. The duke saw it
clearly—great events were preparing.
</p>

<p>
“You were present, I believe,” the duke said to Caracal,
“when I spoke at Phil’s place of the old sorceress,
who is a prophetess for some and a saint for others, and
has more influence in the country than all the journalists
in the world could have. This old woman predicts
the future. I assure you, Caracal, she foretells astonishing
things, absolutely amazing, and I myself have
seen them realized many times over. Just now she is
upsetting the country with talk about the return of
Morgana.”
</p>

<p>
“But there’s no harm in that,” Caracal remarked.
</p>

<p>
“She excites the people, and it will end in war,
that’s all!” answered the duke, gravely. “Ah! the
prophetess and her prophecies—they are a load upon
my back, I can tell you!”
</p>

<p>
“Why don’t you shut her up in a madhouse?”
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_155' name='Page_155' href='#Page_155'>155</a></span>
</p>

<p>
“That’s more easily said than done,” observed the
duke. “An old woman adored by an entire people—you
may not believe me, but—I assure you—she’s
stronger than I!”
</p>

<p>
Caracal looked at the duke to see if he was in
earnest. But a duke’s psychology was entirely beyond
his ken, subtle observer as he was. The duke’s animosity
against the sorceress had a look of embroilment
between sovereigns.
</p>

<p>
While the prospect of all these troubles alienated
the duke from Morgania, so a creature dear to his
heart attracted him homeward. This was his only child,
his son, the little Duke Adalbert. All the duke’s affections
were centered upon this son, after the death of
the duchess. It had not been a happy marriage.
First of all, his wife had made him take a dislike to
his people. She was an Austrian archduchess—more
than an aristocrat, an Olympian; and the fall from the
elegance of Vienna life to severe duties in Morgania
filled her with bitterness. She detested her subjects,
and they paid her back the compliment. Never had a
duchess been so unpopular.
</p>

<p>
Until then,—not to speak of the heroine who had
founded the glory of the house,—all the duchesses had
had the gift of pleasing the people, perhaps because
most of them were themselves sprung from the people.
Love’s fancies had reigned in the house of Tagliaferro,
and, thanks to such spontaneousness of feeling, misalliances
had not been rare. Just as at the Austrian
court Archduke Henry, the emperor’s nephew, had
espoused a dancing-girl who became Baroness Weideck,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_156' name='Page_156' href='#Page_156'>156</a></span>
and before him Archduke John had married the
pretty Anna Plochel, a postmaster’s daughter, so the
Dukes of Morgania, with aristocratic loftiness, chose
their consorts wherever it seemed good to them.
</p>

<p>
Such duchesses the people of Morgania preferred to
all others. It was very important for the future of
the house that she who was to succeed the mother of
Adalbert should possess all those qualities which make
a woman adorable—goodness, beauty, and valor.
</p>

<p>
In Morgania, where diplomatic refinements were unknown,
there was needed a young woman of new
blood, bringing energy with her, and able to revive
confidence. There had been such in the ancestry of
Duke Conrad—heroines sprung from the people,
daughters of the mountain or the plain.
</p>

<p>
“You shall see their statues,” the duke said one
day to Ethel, who had come with her grandmother to
see his collections—“that is, if you do me the honor of
stopping in Morgania when you make your Mediterranean
yacht tour.”
</p>

<p>
“It is a promise,” said Ethel.
</p>

<p>
“It will interest you, Miss Rowrer, to visit my
stronghold. It is one of the most ancient in Europe.
The donjon at the entrance is formidable. It was in
1221, when he returned from the Crusade of Honorius
III and Andrew II, King of Hungary, that my ancestor,
Enguerrand, had it built, along with the great
hall used for the people’s assemblages; for, to procure
the necessary resources of his expedition, he had been
obliged to enfranchise the serfs.”
</p>

<p>
“He did well,” observed grandma.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_157' name='Page_157' href='#Page_157'>157</a></span>
</p>

<p>
“He could not have done better,” the duke replied.
“Moreover, there came out of it the Hall, which is a
masterpiece.”
</p>

<p>
“The Hall, doubtless, is decorated with the arms
and armor of the epoch?—that will interest me
greatly.”
</p>

<p>
“There are neither cuirasses nor gauntlets,” answered
the duke; “neither helmets nor the armor of
knights on horseback, as in the Tower of London or
the Invalides in Paris. But such as it is, it will interest
you even more. It has something that will go
straight to your heart.”
</p>

<p>
“Really?” Ethel asked. “And what can that be?”
</p>

<p>
“This,” the duke went on. “The Walhalla of Bavaria
has been built to German heroes; our Hall is
built to the glory, not of the heroes, but of the heroines
of Morgania. My ancestor, Enguerrand, consecrated
his Hall to the glorification of our women.”
</p>

<p>
“Ah!” Ethel exclaimed, deeply interested.
</p>

<p>
“A great idea!” said grandma. “America ought to
have a hall like that at Lincoln Park. We have our
heroines, too—it would be full in little time!”
</p>

<p>
“Madame Rowrer is right,” said the duke. “To be
a heroine there is no need to fight, sword in hand; the
fulfilment of the civil and moral virtues makes heroines,
and devotedness and love have their own martyrs.
But I am going to show you an old engraving
of the Hall.”
</p>

<p>
The duke rose and searched in a portfolio.
</p>

<p>
“Two characteristic features,” he continued,
“strike one in feudalism: individual energy and improvement
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_158' name='Page_158' href='#Page_158'>158</a></span>
in the condition of women. When Duke
Enguerrand went forth to look for war and adventures,
my ancestress, Bertha, remained in Morgania
as the duke’s representative, clothed with the right of
administering justice, and charged, during his absence,
with the defense and honor of the country. Such sovereign
power often gave to the women of that time
virtues which they had no opportunity of exercising
otherwise.
</p>

<p>
“When the knights and men-at-arms were gone to
the Holy Land, only the women remained at home.
Then Hungary was invaded by the Mongols, who
ravaged everything down to the Adriatic. Morgania
was on the point of perishing; but Bertha the Horsewoman,
as the people called her ever after, scoured
the country the whole winter long, leading convoys,
and bringing in supplies from Italy and mercenaries
from Germany. Thus she repelled the Mongols and
saved Morgania from invasion, and the people from
famine.
</p>

<p>
“When the duke came back he found Morgania in
mourning, for the duchess had died at her task. Saint
Morgana, the heroic ancestress, already had her altars.
The duke wished to consecrate the glory of the
others as well; and he built the Hall so that henceforth
the people might gather around their images under
the saint’s protection. Dying he expressed a wish
that his descendants should dedicate the Hall to the
glory of their women. Here is the engraving,” the
duke said, turning toward Miss Rowrer and grandma.
</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<img src="images/i-173.png" width="363" height="550" alt="" />
<p class="caption">“‘Here is the engraving’”</p>
</div>

<p>
“Indeed,” said Ethel, “all this interests me tremendously.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_159' name='Page_159' href='#Page_159'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_160' name='Page_160' href='#Page_160'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_161' name='Page_161' href='#Page_161'>161</a></span>
So your ancestor Enguerrand was the creator
of women’s rights!”
</p>

<p>
Ethel and grandma examined the engraving. It
represented an octagonal hall of somber and massive
aspect. The eight segments of the vaulted roof
were separated by stone ribbing that met in a fleuron,
from which hung an immense chandelier. The arches
rested on eight columns. Between two of these a solid
wall had been built; it was covered with vestiges of
ancient painting. Stone steps mounted up to this
wall, making a platform on which there was a bench
of carved wood.
</p>

<p>
“Let me be your guide,” said the duke. “This
large wooden bench against the wall between the two
columns is the ducal throne. The stuffs and cushions
which cover it were brought from Tyre and Sidon by
Enguerrand.”
</p>

<p>
“That is very beautiful,” Ethel interrupted, “but
it is your heroines that interest me most—where are
they in all this? Bertha the Horsewoman, where is
she?”
</p>

<p>
“Here—this statue,” the duke replied. “As you see,
there are three statues facing each other—first Bertha,
then Thilda, the duchess who killed Sultan Murad at
Kroja with her own hand, and then Rhodaïs the Slave.
The fourth pedestal is still empty.”
</p>

<p>
“Was there a slave in your ancestry?” Ethel asked.
“It is the name you apply to Rhodaïs.”
</p>

<p>
“She was the daughter of a simple voivode,” said
the duke. “She accompanied to Venice the daughter of
the King of Hungary, whose kingdom had partly fallen
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_162' name='Page_162' href='#Page_162'>162</a></span>
under the power of the Turks. But they were attacked
by an Ottoman galley and every one was massacred
except Rhodaïs. As she trampled the Crescent under
foot they chained her to the rowers’ bench, from which
she escaped only by a shipwreck. She came back to
Morgania, had the duke buy a galley in Venice, chose
a crew of hardy corsairs, and began a war without
mercy against the Turks who infested the coast. She
put herself at the service of Don Juan of Austria
at the battle of Lepanto. My ancestor, Hugh XIII,
made her his duchess, and Philip II of Spain, as a
recompense of her valor, gave her the hereditary title,
unknown till then, of Lady Knight of Malta.”
</p>

<p>
“That was a woman!” Ethel said. “With a
duchess like Rhodaïs a people could not perish! But
Morgana, the fairy, the saint, in whose honor the
Hall was built—I do not see her?”
</p>

<p>
“On the contrary, she is everywhere. She lights
up the Hall with her rays,” the duke replied. “This
engraving does not give the entrance portal which
overlooks city and sea and country. This portal was
made at Enguerrand’s return. It is like the entrance
to an enchanted palace; and by its magnificence and
delicate ornamentation contrasts with the general
severity of the Hall. As in Gothic churches this portal
sets far back into the interior. An immense
stained-glass window overlooks it; and from this light
falls in floods through one of the sides of the vaulted
roof, which was purposely suppressed.”
</p>

<p>
“I understand,” Ethel said. “Face to face with the
ducal throne, your ancestress Morgana dominates everything!”
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_163' name='Page_163' href='#Page_163'>163</a></span>
</p>

<p>
“Yes,” continued the duke; “at eventide the setting
sun enters the interior of the Hall through this
window, which represents the glorious martyrdom of
Morgana. You would say that her blood threw crimson
stains upon the throne itself and the glow of her
miracle lighted up the whole hall.”
</p>

<p>
“What about the fresco which has left traces on
the wall behind the throne? Was it, too, of some warlike
deed?” Ethel asked.
</p>

<p>
“No; this one represented the legend of Morgana
rising from the sea and bringing in her arms what
should be the fortune of Morgania. What was it she
was bringing in her arms? I know not. Morgana,
it appears, was represented in the fresco issuing from
the sea, and covered with seaweed.”
</p>

<p>
“Just as in the picture of Monsieur Phil,” remarked
Ethel.
</p>

<p>
“Exactly so,” said the duke. “It was the moment
I chose; and your fellow-countryman has reconstructed
it. In my next trip to Morgania Monsieur Phil is to
come to the castle and finish his picture on the spot.
Before then I shall have time to search through the
archives, and perhaps I shall find what it was Morgana
was bringing in her arms.”
</p>

<p>
Thereupon Miss Rowrer and grandma went away.
The duke remained alone. He retired to his study—a
den plastered with sporting photographs—and sinking
on a sofa lighted a cigarette and began dreaming
as he followed the light smoke with his eye.
</p>

<p>
“Morgana—she who was to come forth from the
sea bringing fortune and happiness in her arms—is
it not Miss Rowrer landing in her yacht before the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_164' name='Page_164' href='#Page_164'>164</a></span>
castle? She, too, comes from the setting sun. She,
too, brings fortune. She, too, would be adored by the
people. What a strange coincidence! The old sorceress
is not so crazy after all,” the duke said to himself,
“and there is nothing impossible in it! Whatever
may be the personal qualities and fabulous fortune of
Miss Rowrer, a Duke Tagliaferro is her equal. Through
me she would be Duchess of Morgania, Protectress of the
Skipetars, Lady Knight of Malta, Princess of Kroja,
Queen of Antioch in the Holy Land, allied to the court
of Prussia, and cousin of the Hapsburgs. There is not
an older nor a nobler house in Europe.”
</p>

<p>
It made the duke’s head swim only to think of it.
He was a descendant of Hugh, the Frankish chief to
whom Theodosius had given one of his twelve duchies
of the West, and since that time nothing—not even
Attila’s torrent, nor the Turks, nor Charles the V, nor
so many famines, nor so many wars—nothing had ever
struck the sword from the hands of his ancestors—nothing
save the anger of the people against Duke
Adhemar, who was driven from the throne because he
had delivered up Morgana!
</p>

<p>
<i>I will maintain by the sword!</i> This proud device
had never proved false, as the old iron-bound archives
could witness. The duke felt weary—weary
with all the weariness and old with all the age of
all his ancestors; and his fingers had scarcely the
strength to knock the ashes from his cigarette.
</p>

<p>
What a youth his inheritance of glory had won for
him! How he had envied in other days the little
peasants who ran barefoot along the beach, whereas
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_165' name='Page_165' href='#Page_165'>165</a></span>
he, brought up by sad-faced priests in the old feudal
castle, was less free than a slave. Then came his marriage,
which had been settled for him for reasons of
state, and the death of his father, which gave him
the administration of the duchy—an ungrateful task.
No! He had not lived! Enough of the gloomy palace
and rude peasants! He wished to live and to be
amused—to be young for once in his life. He would
know happiness, at least!
</p>

<p>
The duke gazed at the blue curls of smoke floating
as aimlessly as himself. He had not even hoped for
a marriage like this with Miss Rowrer, having all the
advantages of a royal marriage, without any of its inconveniences.
She would be one of the richest and
most brilliant sovereigns of Europe.
</p>

<p>
Never had life appeared sweeter to him than now.
He was buoyed up with hope and illusions. There was
this marriage for the near future, and meanwhile he
could enjoy the little time he still had to pass in
Paris. This evening, for instance, he was to go with
Caracal and meet Helia behind the scenes of the Nouveau-Cirque.
Perhaps he was thinking more than he
ought of Helia, but he wished to thank her before his
departure for having posed as Morgana.
</p>

<p>
A lackey broke in upon his reverie, handing the
duke two cartes-de-visite on a silver plate.
</p>

<p>
“Zrnitschka!”
</p>

<p>
“Bjelopawlitji!”
</p>

<p>
“The devil!” said the duke. “My two voivodes—my
two kill-joys!”
</p>

<p>
Ah! those two sad-faced “ambassadors of the sorceress”—would
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_166' name='Page_166' href='#Page_166'>166</a></span>
they never cease harassing him? The
valet spoke:
</p>

<p>
“The gentlemen wish to have the honor of presenting
their homage to monseigneur.”
</p>

<p>
“Yes; I am acquainted with their homage,” the
duke said, below his voice, as he drew out his watch.
“Half-past six, and Caracal is waiting for me—and
Helia, whom I have to see—”
</p>

<p>
“What answer shall I give these gentlemen?” asked
the valet.
</p>

<p>
“How do I know!” answered the duke, vexed at
being troubled while thinking of so many things.
“Tell them—oh, tell them I am having a political interview—a
tête-à-tête with the representative of a
great power!”
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_167' name='Page_167' href='#Page_167'>167</a></span>
</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h3>
CHAPTER II
<br />
A PARISIAN DÉBUT
</h3>

<p>
The duke, imposing and superb, was present; and
Caracal, with his monocle in his eye, was beside
him. It was the first night of Helia. If it had
been a common first night at the Théâtre Français, the
duke would have thought himself dishonored by appearing
before the second act. But he wished to offer
a rose to Helia, and so he, a gentleman, had committed
and made Caracal commit an unheard-of thing—they
had dined between seven and eight so as to arrive on
time.
</p>

<p>
“You are interested in behind the scenes? Your
presence greatly honors us, monseigneur,” said the director
of the Cirque as he passed by them.
</p>

<p>
Was he interested? He was more than that—he was
enthralled.
</p>

<p>
First of all, Caracal suggested it was very chic to
have the air of paying court to Helia, who to-morrow
would be celebrated as a star. This would give an
irresistible Don Juan mark to his ducal title.
</p>

<p>
“That will help me with Miss Rowrer,” thought
the duke, who was pupil and plaything of the clever
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_168' name='Page_168' href='#Page_168'>168</a></span>
Caracal. There was a single shadow in his picture—Phil
was not there!
</p>

<p>
Phil was to accompany Miss Rowrer to the American
Club Exhibition; but this touched the duke—oh,
so very slightly. Miss Rowrer had a great esteem for
Phil, but pshaw! a poor devil of an artist was no
rival for him, a duke with his duchy, descended from
fairies and queens and saints! Against all this what
could avail her innocent flirtation with Phil?
</p>

<p>
The public had not yet come and the hall was empty.
Here and there the electric globes were lighting up;
but the duke and Caracal beheld a sight which helped
them to pass the time. The sensational equestrienne,
the Marquesa de Guerrera, was coming down the steps,
enameled and rouged and resplendent with diamonds.
Monseigneur gallantly held her stirrup as she painfully
climbed upon her horse. She dashed out on the
track in front of the empty benches for a short rehearsal.
She asked for the orchestra and the lights,
to accustom her horse to the noise and glitter. She
was afraid he would take fright. She trembled at his
slightest shying.
</p>

<p>
“Take away that white paper—that program on the
bench; take it away! And do you applaud!” the
Marquesa called to the stable-boys who approached the
ring.
</p>

<p>
“Applaud! to accustom him to the bravos!”
</p>

<p>
The horse began turning like a great mechanical
plaything with a doll on its back.
</p>

<p>
“The horse does all the work!” said Suzanne behind
the duke. She had just arrived with Helia and
Sœurette, Helia’s little sister.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_169' name='Page_169' href='#Page_169'>169</a></span>

</p>

<p>
“No, I assure you,” said Helia, “<i>haute école</i> riding
is difficult!”
</p>

<p>
The duke turned.
</p>

<p>
“How do you do, mesdemoiselles?” he said, lifting
his hat.
</p>

<p>
“Monseigneur—” Helia began.
</p>

<p>
“Oh, monsieur,” Sœurette broke in, “it’s for me,
isn’t it?—the pretty rose?”
</p>

<p>
“Why—why—yes!” the duke answered, giving the
flower to the child.
</p>

<p>
He remarked Helia’s surprise. She seemed troubled
by his visit. It had been the affair of a moment, but
it was sufficient to hinder the duke, who was no apt
pupil of Caracal, from giving the rose to Helia.
</p>

<p>
“You lack nerve!” Caracal whispered in his ear.
</p>

<p>
“It will come!” answered monseigneur.
</p>

<p>
“I see the duke and Caracal,” Helia said to herself;
“but Phil is not here! It’s not very nice of him.”
</p>

<p>
The public was coming in. The equestrienne left off
rehearsing, with her hat over one ear.
</p>

<p>
“Come, we have to get ready,” said Helia. “Au
revoir, messieurs!”
</p>

<p>
The benches were filling up. Against the dark shadows
of the boxes fans waved to and fro. The duke
straightened up in the respectful space which his title
of monseigneur left around him. Near him was Cemetery,
the clown, waiting for Helia, whom he was to
accompany in the ring. He shook the yellow tresses of
his wig and groaned constantly, complaining of his
aches and speaking of a return to his box to rub himself
with camphorated alcohol.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_172' name='Page_172' href='#Page_172'>172</a></span>
</p>

<p>
“Do you want me to go with you—I’ll rub you!”
the duke said, Parisian to the finger-tips, and hoping,
if he rubbed the old clown’s spine, that he would
redeem in Caracal’s eyes the rose given to Sœurette.
</p>

<p>
“No, thank you, monseigneur. There is nothing to
be done,” said the old clown; “I, too, was famous, and
now I’m only an old dog—ah!”
</p>

<p>
But no one listened to him.
</p>

<p>
The show began. In the ring the blond hair and
doll face of Louise Bingel whirled to the music of
the orchestra, as she leaned over to apply the whip to
her horse’s neck with many a “Go!” and “Up!”
</p>

<p>
The public talked as it looked through the program.
The real show was to come later. It was not the
“Gallinaro Family, somersaults, bravourturnerin, tapis-tumblers,”
nor “Miss Soho, the world’s greatest I-don’t-know-what,”
nor “Princess Colibri and her
Prince-Consort”—no! that which attracted the public
was, first and foremost, Helia. Discreet notes in the
papers had given hopes that there would be something
“never seen before.” Some said she was a young girl
of good family, whom an irresistible vocation had drawn
to the circus. Details, too, were given of her career—in
contradiction with one another, of course.
</p>

<p>
What was not known, though, was how Helia had been
working for months. She was going to try a daring
feat. Even the costume was to be new. To her the
nudity of the maillot seemed brutal.
</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<a name="i-187" id="i-187"></a>
<img src="images/i-187.png" width="341" height="550" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Cemetery</p>
</div>

<p>
“Beauty is well, talent is better!” Cemetery, her
professor in other days, used to say; and she wished
to be applauded for her art and not for her beauty.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_173' name='Page_173' href='#Page_173'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_174' name='Page_174' href='#Page_174'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_175' name='Page_175' href='#Page_175'>175</a></span>
Her wonderful gymnastic knowledge gave her the
right to attempt the feat.
</p>

<p>
She thought in gestures. She had in her the inborn
love of grace and physical force. With graceful movement
she summed up a thousand things which she
could not have said; and she had the idea of reviving
the acrobatics of the ancients, just as others have reconstructed
the songs of old times, and the dance
through the ages. One day at the Louvre she had seen
on a Greek vase an artistic dance which struck her.
She had spoken of it to Phil while posing for Morgana—for
Helia saw Phil often.
</p>

<p>
In spite of all, she loved to be near him, and though
Phil might forget, on her side she felt her love for
him only increase. She was one of those proud hearts
which love but once. In spite of all, she believed in
the sacredness of a sworn promise. Phil would come
back to her! Besides, Phil was a precious help in
the work she was undertaking. Together they consulted
the “Recherches Historiques et Critiques sur les
Mimes et Pantomimes du Seigneur de Rivery.” Her
head was full of neurobatie, scheunobatie, and acrobatie.
She dreamed of gymnastics and the dance. She
studied her movements in Phil’s studio, in the evening,
after his work.
</p>

<p>
He had a jointed lay-figure which she put in the
proper poses, seeking for effects in its curving and
bending back. She cut out little costumes and tried
them on it. She went to the Library, and looked through
the boxes of the booksellers along the Quais. The instinct
of the beautiful guided her. She composed her
number as she might compose a poem.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_176' name='Page_176' href='#Page_176'>176</a></span>
</p>

<p>
The reverse of a Roman medal and an old engraving
representing the Genoese who descended the towers
of Notre Dame, torch in hand, to offer a crown to
Queen Isabeau suggested ideas to her. A biography
of Madame Saqui, who was called the first acrobat of
the empire, and whom Napoleon entitled <i>mon enragée</i>,
was very useful to her.
</p>

<p>
“Plato,” Phil said to her one day when they were
studying together, “Plato contends that gymnastics
give grace to the movements of the body, of which
we ought to think even before adorning the mind.”
</p>

<p>
“Plato is wrong,” was Helia’s answer.
</p>

<p>
But she proved that he was right by the moral
energy which physical training had developed in her.
For months she studied without let-up, mastering rebellious
muscles, beginning again, twenty times over,
the same thing, setting to work with all her heart and
all her courage, with clenched teeth and eyes shining
with the pride of will. There was despair in her mad
energy.
</p>

<p>
“But you will kill yourself, Helia,” Phil said to her.
</p>

<p>
“Nonsense!” said Helia. “I will die or do it!”
</p>

<p>
“In other days,” she thought in her simplicity,
“Phil did not like to hear me speaking of my trade;
but who knows?—he may change if I become a <i>grande
artiste</i>.”
</p>

<p>
That evening she was to present to the public the
outcome of her efforts.
</p>

<p>
Suzanne, in the dress of a pretty little Pierrette,
was already in the ring. With her usual go she was
showing off trained rabbits. They jumped through
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_177' name='Page_177' href='#Page_177'>177</a></span>
hoops, climbed up on her, and ate seeds from her hand.
It made a little interlude before Helia’s number.
</p>

<p>
At the entrance of the stables clowns and firemen,
reporters and men of sport made up a guard of honor.
There was even an impresario from New York, who
spoke to Suzanne when she came out.
</p>

<p>
“Brava, mademoiselle! Ah! if you only knew how
to sing!”
</p>

<p>
“If I only knew how to sing!—<i>Je t’écoute!</i>”
</p>

<p>
“Brava! brava! You’ll have a success in New
York! You’ll come on the stage, they’ll ask you
if you know how to sing—and you’ll answer—how
was it you said it?”
</p>

<p>
“<i>Je t’écoute</i> [I hear you].”
</p>

<p>
“That’s it! You must also bring in a little can-can—do
you know how to dance?”
</p>

<p>
“There’s a question for you!” And with the point
of her elegant foot Suzanne, scarcely seeming to touch
it, sent the shining silk hat of the impresario rolling
on the ground.
</p>

<p>
“Brava! Perfect!” the impresario cried in an ecstasy
of joy. “I’ve found what I’m looking for—a
typical French girl!”
</p>

<p>
There was silence. In the luminous void of the circus,
high up in the air there were shining things in
nickel—trapezes—and a rope was stretched down to the
ring.
</p>

<p>
The orchestra burst forth. Helia kissed Sœurette
and passed out with a run before the duke and Caracal.
Her mantle, left hanging as if by chance, gave
a glimpse of a rosy shoulder. On the threshold of the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_178' name='Page_178' href='#Page_178'>178</a></span>
ring she stopped and threw off the mantle. It was
like the unveiling of a statue.
</p>

<p>
She wore the short tunic of the dancers of Pergamus.
The clinging stuff was fastened at the shoulder
and hung to a point on each side, leaving arms and
neck and the upper part of the breast uncovered; a
light skirt fell straight to the ankles.
</p>

<p>
Helia looked at the public long enough to smile and
bow. Then, with a quick spring, she leaped to the
tightly stretched rope, and with agile bare feet
climbed up its incline to the platform in front of her
trapeze. The light brought out the whiteness of her
skin and her red cheeks, and glittered back from a
little star-shaped jewel in the black hair above her
forehead.
</p>

<p>
There was a murmur of sympathy. The public applauded
and cried: “Brava!” Helia had done nothing
yet, but the audience was already won. The orchestra,
after a moment’s silence, suddenly broke forth and
Helia began.
</p>

<p>
At first, to accustom the public to the notion of
the movements, she leaped upright on the trapeze,
which swung over to the platform. This had been
foreseen. The three trapezes in their swing almost
touched each other. They were hung from light steel
tubes and oscillated like a single mechanism, without
break or twist.
</p>

<p>
Helia, with infinite grace, went through a few exercises.
It was the Waking of the Goddess—the first
astonished gestures of a statue called to life by the
inspiration of a Pygmalion. Then she let herself fall
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_179' name='Page_179' href='#Page_179'>179</a></span>
as if overcome by dizziness, grasped the bar as she
slipped down without apparent shock, and—almost
before the folds of her gown could fall back gracefully—she
was again on the trapeze, magnificent and
at her ease. She balanced herself gently and gave a
backward leap to the platform.
</p>

<p>
The public broke forth in applause. It felt itself in
the presence of a healthy and robust art. This was
no acrobat limited to one single task, with legs heavy
by dint of walking on the ball, or shoulders by walking
on the hands. But here was the accomplished
gymnast—the all-round artiste, with her muscles obedient
and supple. In her they acclaimed the poetry
of the body and the melody of movement.
</p>

<p>
To give Helia a moment’s rest, Cemetery entered,
stumbled at the entrance of the ring, fell on his nose,
rolled over, and pulled himself up by the rope. His
pantomime expressed delight and fear at the spectacle,
high above him, of this creature of light and
beauty. His pursed-up mouth and rounded eyes had
the look of weeping. He walked out scratching his
wig.
</p>

<p>
The public laughed.
</p>

<p>
Helia made a sign and looked to the trapezes
oscillating. Suddenly, to a joyous strain, she leaped
forward. The orchestra seemed to uphold her in her
flight. Nothing could be more graceful than the pose
of her skirt, which fluttered from her ankles like a
pair of wings. Then Helia leaped to the second trapeze
just as the two bars almost touched. Her hand
grasped the steel tube with a sudden effort, which
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_180' name='Page_180' href='#Page_180'>180</a></span>
her art concealed. Then, letting go, she continued
her dizzy balancing and leaped to the third trapeze,
as calm as Fortune on her Wheel. She had crossed the
entire space of the circus at a single flight and fallen
upright on the other platform just as a wingless Victory
finds rest on the pediment of a temple.
</p>

<p>
“Hurrah! Brava! brava!”
</p>

<p>
Helia cast a look of triumph on the crowd.
</p>

<p>
“What an artiste!” the duke murmured. Could
this really be she who but a moment ago was talking
like any comrade—this prodigy who was holding the
hall enthralled, and bringing in a crush to the door
all the stable crowd and artistes, gentlemen in evening
dress, and the whole tumult of clowns?
</p>

<p>
Sœurette looked at her “big sister” in wonder and
delight, while her lips seemed to murmur a prayer.
Cemetery entered the ring again to proclaim the distress
of man and his unrealizable desires. He jumped
up to the rope, climbed a yard or two, and fell back
flat on the ground. <i>Poum!</i> Come on! the goddess
seemed to say to him. He tried again, but from the
height of his Olympus the leader of the orchestra
thundered him down with a stroke of the bass-drum, and
he fell again—<i>poum!</i>—remaining on his back with
his four limbs wriggling in the air. Then he dragged
himself away, broken and bruised, with halting leg
and rubbing his shoulder, while above him Helia appeared
as an apparition, a shining form rid of the
heaviness of the flesh.
</p>

<img src="images/i-195.png" width="357" height="550" alt="" />
<p class="caption">At the Circus</p>
</div>

<p>
Her art astonished the public. There was no perceptible
effort,—<i>Jarret lâchés</i>, high leaps, whirls,—there
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_181' name='Page_181' href='#Page_181'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_182' name='Page_182' href='#Page_182'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_183' name='Page_183' href='#Page_183'>183</a></span>
was nothing of all that. She gave the sensation of the
“something never seen before.” Merely by the way in
which she touched her trapeze with the point of her
bare feet, one felt that she was free from rules—inventive,
a genius. It was youth and beauty, scorn of danger,
and courage holding spellbound the crowd below her.
</p>

<p>
Her artistic intelligence profited even by obstacles.
Thus Helia disdained the net; but the law imposed it.
She found a means of making it serve her own purposes.
</p>

<p>
Just as she was ending, a globe was passed up to
her, and she placed it on the bar. Then she stood upright
on it, in the vast oscillations of the trapeze. She
was like a goddess soaring in space with the earth
under her feet.
</p>

<p>
Then Helia stopped motionless.
</p>

<p>
The orchestra ceased; the lights were extinguished;
and suddenly, like a star falling in the night, Helia
fell down to the net.
</p>

<p>
There was a moment’s anguish, and then the lights
and orchestra—lightning and thunder—began again,
as in a storm. Helia was on the ground, offering, with
a gesture, her heart to the crowd.
</p>

<p>
She was called back again and again. Bouquets
were thrown to her—the public would have her out
once more! At last she retired, worn out, and, putting
off her stage-smile, she shook hands all round.
</p>

<p>
“There’ll be no bouquets left for the marquesa,”
Suzanne said. “But her horse may be accustomed,
by this time, to the bravos!”
</p>

<p>
“You must be tired, Mademoiselle Helia?” the duke
asked.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_184' name='Page_184' href='#Page_184'>184</a></span>
</p>

<p>
“It’s my trade,” said Helia. “We smile to the
public all the same; it would not be nice to show that
it is work!”
</p>

<p>
And, with a gracious salutation to the duke, she
went back to her dressing-room.
</p>

<p>
“You haven’t invited her to supper!” Caracal remarked
to the duke, when she had gone.
</p>

<p>
“I didn’t think of it!”
</p>

<p>
“Are you going to wait till she comes down?”
</p>

<p>
“No,” said the duke, intimidated. “I shall see her
later, I hope. Your valet must attend to it. Let’s go
now. There’s nothing to see after Helia!”
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_185' name='Page_185' href='#Page_185'>185</a></span>

<h3>
CHAPTER III
<br />
PHIL, CHAMPION OF MISS ROWRER
</h3>

<p>
“I’ll send her some flowers to-morrow,” the duke
said, once they were outside.
</p>

<p>
“Monseigneur,” replied Caracal, “allow me to
tell you, you’ve been below the mark all through!”
</p>

<p>
“That’s so!” agreed monseigneur.
</p>

<p>
“For a reigning duke,” Caracal went on, “a grand
seigneur, a Parisian in soul, to have such timidity! It
was worth while dining at impossible hours and passing
evenings with a rheumatic clown, to wind up in
nothing!”
</p>

<p>
“I shall have my revenge!” the duke said. “This
evening I did not—dare.”
</p>

<p>
“And the reason is this,” Caracal continued:
“you’re in love with Helia!”
</p>

<p>
“I!”
</p>

<p>
“Yes, monseigneur.”
</p>

<p>
“What an idea!”
</p>

<p>
Just then Caracal passed into the two-colored light
of an apothecary’s shop, red on one side and green
on the other; his single eye-glass darted a fantastic
reflection on the duke. He might have been twin
brother to Mephistopheles.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_186' name='Page_186' href='#Page_186'>186</a></span>
</p>

<p>
“What a devil of a man!” thought the duke; “you
can hide nothing from him. He might easily be
right!”
</p>

<p>
Caracal had not astonished him. In love? Perhaps
he was, since others were noticing it. It is true that
Caracal was not exactly “others,” powerful psychologist
and searcher of hearts and brains as he was.
But even Caracal would have to confess himself beaten
by a Duke of Morgania parading with a circus star—that
would be Parisian enough! He would no longer
accuse him of inheriting the prejudices of Morgania,
nor of believing in the predictions of the mad old
witch!
</p>

<p>
The duke blushed at his own scruples. He envied
Caracal’s effrontery.
</p>

<p>
“It is true,” he said to himself, “I have been below
the mark all through. For a grand seigneur like me
to be as timid as a college-boy is absurd. Helia ought
to be for me simply an episode—a pastime—and nothing
more.”
</p>

<p>
All these ideas had come to him while he was lighting
his cigarette, and Caracal, red and green, was
darting on him the reflection of his monocle.
</p>

<p>
“In love with Helia?” the duke said aloud, flattered
that Caracal had such an opinion of him, “<i>ma
foi</i>, why not?”
</p>

<p>
“You are quite right,” answered Caracal. “It will
increase your prestige. Besides, you’ll see her at
supper. My valet will hand her the invitation. Helia
would rather go off alone, but she will come with
us. Phil will be of the party, too!”
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_187' name='Page_187' href='#Page_187'>187</a></span>
</p>

<p>
“Well, come along! We have an hour to wait. Let’s
go in somewhere,” said the duke.
</p>

<p>
They were just coming into the Place Blanche. A
café, through its open doors, wrapped them round with
the smell of alcohol. Before them a red-winged mill
seemed grinding fire and flame. Beyond, streets went
climbing up Montmartre, mountain of guano. Right
and left, along the Boulevard, incredible dens held out
their blazing signs in line, like the “Mene, mene, tekel,
upharsin” of monstrous nights.
</p>

<p>
“Here is a cabaret artistique; let’s go in,” said
Caracal; “it’s immense!”
</p>

<p>
“Come on!” assented the duke.
</p>

<p>
The atmosphere, as of a den of animals, caught
them by the throat. The conversations were deafening,
but the voice of the proprietor rose above the
clamor. He welcomed visitors, even ladies, with a
torrent of insults. It was the height of chic to receive
his avalanche of insolence with a smiling face.
</p>

<p>
“What do these two carrion come for?” he cried,
pointing to Caracal and the duke, who, in his surprise,
was on the point of getting angry, to the great joy
of the public.
</p>

<p>
“Let’s sit in this corner; we can talk better,” Caracal
said to him, as much at his ease in this asphyxiating
air as a fish in water. They sat down and the
brutal voice and the clamors of the public found occupation
elsewhere.
</p>

<p>
“Talk?” asked the duke. “What in the world
should we talk about here?”
</p>

<p>
“About Helia,” answered Caracal; “here’s to your
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_188' name='Page_188' href='#Page_188'>188</a></span>
amours, monseigneur!” And he raised the glass which
a waiter, dressed like an Academician, had brought
him.
</p>

<p>
“Caracal!” said the duke, laughing, “we no longer
live in the times when kings espoused shepherdesses.”
</p>

<p>
“But dukes, monseigneur, still pay their court to
danseuses,” Caracal went on. “It’s a tendency of the
aristocracy.”
</p>

<p>
“Why?” asked the duke.
</p>

<p>
“Because the common run of men, when they
court a woman, make account of what others think
of her; whereas a grand seigneur doesn’t care for
the opinion of the public and chooses what pleases
him.”
</p>

<p>
“That’s true!” said the duke.
</p>

<p>
“I can cite you a dozen examples,” Caracal continued.
“There’s Clotilde Loisset, the circus-rider, who
is an Hungarian princess to-day; Chelli, the danseuse,
married to a Russian count who is Minister of State;
Lord Billy, betrothed to an equilibrist; the Countess of
Landsfeldt, Baroness Rosenthal—you know well who
they were. And you see what they are now, thanks to
the caprice of some Highness! Grandees, monseigneur,
are like those kings who acknowledge no rank but that
which they themselves create.”
</p>

<p>
“Well said, Caracal!”
</p>

<p>
The duke, when his first surprise had passed, found
it amusing to talk confidentially in such a moral pig-pen.
It was so amusing, even, that he forgot to ask
himself what possible interest Caracal could have to
see him in love with Helia.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_189' name='Page_189' href='#Page_189'>189</a></span>
</p>

<p>
“Will you come now, Caracal? Phil must be waiting
for us.”
</p>

<p>
“Helia, too!” said Caracal.
</p>

<p>
They left the place.
</p>

<p>
“We are leaving just as it is becoming interesting,”
Caracal sighed. “It’s over there we are to meet,”
he added, pointing to the terrace of a café inundated
with light.
</p>

<p>
They had not gone twenty steps before a voice
called to them. It was Phil’s.
</p>

<p>
“Good evening, Monsieur le Duc! Good evening,
M. Caracal!”
</p>

<p>
“Good evening, Phil!” answered Caracal. “<i>Eh
bien?</i> How’s your American Club exposition? Interesting?
Painting in the grand style? American
painting, eh! eh! done by machinery, of course?
I don’t say that for you, <i>cher ami</i>!”
</p>

<p>
“And how is your novel, ‘The House of Glass’?” retorted
Phil, leaving painting for literature. “You
were just now in search of human documents. Don’t
say no; I saw you! You’re always thinking about it?”
</p>

<p>
“Always, my dear friend, always! But what
makes you think so?”
</p>

<p>
“Because you were looking in the gutter,” said
Phil.
</p>

<p>
Caracal made a grimace; but when they got to the
café his self-love had a satisfaction which brought
back his smiles. Before the terrace, encumbered
with people, his valet was awaiting him, telegrams
in hand. This valet was a part of his pride of life;
a good fellow employed in a shop all day long, and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_190' name='Page_190' href='#Page_190'>190</a></span>
free in the evening. Caracal dressed him up in a
tail coat with gilt buttons, and a high hat, and had
him bring his correspondence to the café every night,
as if he were a man overwhelmed with invitations and
billets-doux.
</p>

<p>
“Mademoiselle Helia will not come this evening,”
the valet announced.
</p>

<p>
“Why not?” Caracal asked, interrupting the reading
of his despatches, which he had good reasons for
knowing by heart.
</p>

<p>
“Mademoiselle Helia did not say why. Mademoiselle
only said that she would not come. She has
gone out with M. Socrate.”
</p>

<p>
“Very well!” said Caracal, dismissing his valet.
</p>

<p>
“With Socrate! Poor Helia!” thought Phil.
</p>

<p>
“Well, messieurs, it will be less gay without a
lady,” Caracal observed; “but since we are here, let’s
do Montmartre, will you?”
</p>

<p>
“Come with us,” said the duke.
</p>

<p>
So all three “did” Montmartre.
</p>

<p>
Caracal knew it all thoroughly. The cabaret was
his home. He entered offhand; he had his own manner
of opening the door and bidding a friendly good
day to the proprietor amid the tables.
</p>

<p>
“There’s Caracal!” These words, pronounced in
the smoke of these little cafés by some <i>décadent</i> accompanied
by a painted girl, swelled his heart with
pride. Even the duke envied him this quasi-royalty
which Paris confers on its elect.
</p>

<p>
Caracal loved the cabaret <i>rosses</i>, where some rickety
little monsieur advances on the platform, opens
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_191' name='Page_191' href='#Page_191'>191</a></span>
his snarling mouth and, hammering his words that not
a syllable may be lost, narrates his little nastiness to the
public.
</p>

<p>
“It’s a new school,” Caracal explained. “Much
more advanced than the <i>décadents</i>! It’s educating
the public up to itself little by little. It has taken
frankly for its flag the exact word in all its crudity.”
</p>

<p>
“Say, rather, the dirty word,” said Phil.
</p>

<p>
Wherever they went there was the same atmosphere
of infection. You would have said that, camping
in modern Paris, there was a <i>ville chaude</i> of the
Middle Ages, where “<i>vérolez très précieux</i>” made
high festival with ribald companions. The look of the
places was repulsive. In one they were served by
mock galley-slaves dragging their chains behind them.
In another there were grave-diggers, and they sat by
coffins, and green flames burned inside of skulls.
</p>

<p>
“You, fever-patient, what do you take?” the waiter
said to the customer; “and you, consumptive? What
do you drink, moribund?”
</p>

<p>
And then the fever-patient or the moribund—some
ruddy young man from Scotland—would answer timidly:
“<i>Oune bock</i>.”
</p>

<p>
“That gives a high idea of Paris,” Phil said, as they
went out. To him it all seemed stupid. What a contrast
for him, after an evening passed with Ethel, were
these pestiferous dives with their brute public, like pigs
at the fattening! The pitiful sight recalled to him the
weak-willed days of the past, the evenings at the Deux
Magots, the masterpieces drawn in pencil on café tables
and wiped off with a rag.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_192' name='Page_192' href='#Page_192'>192</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Caracal made a study of the different cabarets, preferring
this one to that and drawing a dilettante’s
distinctions between their poets and singers.
</p>

<p>
“Such an one enunciates well. Have you heard his
ballad of ‘The Drunkard and the Rotting Dog’? That
is art!”
</p>

<p>
And with an elegant gesture he fixed the monocle
in his eye. Phil examined Caracal and tried to discern
in his face the low instincts, the hatreds, the
thumb-marks of degeneracy. He saw nothing but self-satisfaction.
</p>

<p>
They had arrived at The Pustule, the latest <i>cabaret
artistique</i>.
</p>

<p>
“Let’s go in!” Caracal proposed. “It shall be the
last.”
</p>

<p>
“I shall leave you afterward,” said Phil.
</p>

<p>
They entered. A blonde girl, with a thin, colorless
voice and childish gestures and little smirks, was singing:
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">“Les bosquets du Bois d’Boulogne</p>
<p>Ous’ qu’on fait Zizi pan pan!”</p>
</div></div>

<p>
Her place was taken by a <i>chansonnier rosse</i>, fat and
bald. This one began at once, in an aggressive tone, a
political satire. What? there was a couplet against
Americans—Richard the Lion-hearted again, and then
a direct allusion to a certain American miss—in this
sewer!
</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<img src="images/i-207.png" width="550" height="355" alt="" />
<p class="caption">“Phil rose up, pale with anger”</p>
</div>

<p>
Phil rose up, pale with anger. He would have
smashed things, and shut the mouth of the fat brute
bellowing on the stage; but suddenly he thought that
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_193' name='Page_193' href='#Page_193'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_194' name='Page_194' href='#Page_194'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_195' name='Page_195' href='#Page_195'>195</a></span>
he might compromise Miss Rowrer. He sat down,
clenching his fist.
</p>

<p>
“I’d like to know who writes such infamous
songs!” he said to Caracal.
</p>

<p>
“Bah, never mind! Calm yourself!” Caracal answered,
with sudden uneasiness. “Never mind; it’s
not worth while. No one understands!”
</p>

<p>
“What a set of fools!” Phil went on. “I’m going
away; I choke here!”
</p>

<p>
“We’ll go with you,” added the Duke of Morgania.
</p>

<p>
A moment later Phil took his leave of the duke and
Caracal, to return home. From the other side of the
street he saw Caracal gesticulating and explaining
modern art to the duke. Fragmentary sentences
reached his ear: “<i>Chansonniers rosses</i>—off with all

CHAPTER IV
<br />
’TWIXT DOG AND POET
</h3>

<p>
Phil went his way, leaving the duke and Caracal
behind him.
</p>

<p>
He was angry with himself for having come.
Especially he was frightened at the feeling which had
just been urging him to punish the singer on the stage.
There was something more in it than the natural indignation
of an upright heart in presence of a low action.
He felt it a hundred times more than he would have
done for a personal insult. He stood forth revealed
to himself as the champion of Miss Rowrer.
</p>

<p>
On the whole, the verses were stupid rather than
malignant; but it had been stronger than he—an explosion,
in a way, of a growing passion. He resolved
to stop short on this dangerous descent and not allow
himself to be lured on by an impossible love, the very
thought of which seemed to him worthy of blame.
</p>

<p>
Phil was not content with his evening, so well begun
and so ill ended.
</p>

<p>
“They’ll not catch me again doing Montmartre with
Caracal and the duke,” he said to himself. “I was
wrong to go there to-night. I have become certain that
Helia is letting herself be courted by Socrate. To have
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_197' name='Page_197' href='#Page_197'>197</a></span>
come down like that—she whom I knew so reserved
and sweet! And I know something else, too. I have
to stop flirting with Miss Rowrer—perhaps even stop
seeing her, poor fool that I am!”
</p>

<p>
And Phil went his way with lowered head, absorbed
in his own reflections.
</p>

<p>
Phil’s idea was right so far as Miss Rowrer was
concerned. He might really have been in danger. But
he was mistaken in his appreciation of Helia, for she
had not quit the circus with Socrate. Socrate had followed
her, that was all—Suzanne having taken away
Sœurette immediately after the departure of the duke
and Caracal. Helia, worn out with fatigue, went away
much later on the arm of old Cemetery.
</p>

<p>
She was full of deference for the man who had made
her an artiste, and she accompanied him back to his
hotel. Socrate walked alongside, without the least
emotion at the sight of this Antigone protecting her
Œdipus; rather, he was furious that she should lose
her time with such a doddard; but he had nothing to
say about it! Helia would not have understood, and
Socrate remembered spitefully that the duke and
Caracal were cooling their heels in vain expectation
of her.
</p>

<p>
Afterward Socrate saw her home. He had so many
things to say to her—things he dared not utter.
</p>

<p>
However, at the moment of taking leave he expressed
a wish to go in, in order to speak more freely.
</p>

<p>
“No, thank you!” said Helia; “you would wake
Sœurette, who is already in bed.”
</p>

<p>
“But—”
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_198' name='Page_198' href='#Page_198'>198</a></span>
</p>

<p>
“Besides, you have your own work.” And she shut
the door in his face.
</p>

<p>
Socrate, in a rage, remained outside. What he could
not say this evening he would say to-morrow; so be it!
But that he—Socrate, poet, thinker, painter, sculptor,
and musician—should be so treated by this little mountebank—what
a humiliation! He felt that he wanted
to break something. A wandering dog passed by, and
with all his strength he gave him a kick in the ribs.
</p>

<p>
“There, put that in your pocket!”
</p>

<p>
“And you take that!” And Socrate received a
heavy blow, with which he rolled to the ground.
</p>

<p>
It seemed to him as he fell that he flung out his arms
to protect himself, and that his fist came in contact with
a head. When he was stretched out on the pavement
he saw standing on the curbstone a man, motionless and
looking at him. They were both in the light of a street-lamp.
Suddenly Socrate recognized Phil.
</p>

<p>
In fact, Phil had been coming down the street just
as Socrate kicked the poor animal. In his indignation
Phil punished the brute, and then immediately recognized
in him Socrate, who, of course, so he thought,
was coming from Helia.
</p>

<p>
Socrate would have jumped on Phil, but he had
neither knife nor revolver. So he remained on the
pavement, crazy with impotent rage. Phil, remaining
calm, picked up his hat, which had fallen in the scuffle.
He waited. But as the thinker contented himself with
groaning, he went his way without even a look behind.
</p>

<p>
“Helia! Helia!” he thought within himself, “that
you should receive such a creature!”

<h3>
CHAPTER V
<br />
LITTLE SISTER OF A STAR
</h3>

<p>
The next day Helia was still sleeping when Sœurette
aroused her. The little one was trotting along
the carpet in her bare feet, talking and laughing
to herself in the sunny room. It was her great happiness
in the morning to be up first and take her big
sister by surprise. She climbed on the bed and awoke
her with a good kiss on the cheek.
</p>

<p>
“Ah, how you frightened me!” cried Helia, pretending
fear.
</p>

<p>
Sœurette burst into laughter.
</p>

<p>
“Let me lie beside you; I’ll let you sleep!”
</p>

<p>
“Are you sleeping?” the little one asked a moment
later. “Ah, you see, you’re not sleeping. <i>Eh bien!</i> tell
me a story!”
</p>

<p>
“You know,” replied Helia, “if you’re not good
you sha’n’t do the trapeze to-day.”
</p>

<p>
This threat quieted Sœurette.
</p>

<p>
Helia did not wish to make a gymnast of her. Ah,
no! She dreamed of other things for her—anything
except that! But she had taught her a few turns to
develop her, and the little girl took the greatest pleasure
in it.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_202' name='Page_202' href='#Page_202'>202</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Soon, won by the warmth of the bed, Sœurette fell
asleep. Helia arose gently and finished waking herself
with an invigorating bath in cold water. Then she put
on her great peignoir, tying the girdle around her
waist. To keep herself supple she went through two or
three of her flections, bending herself backward, forward,
turning her bust on her haunches, breathing
again and again long and deep. The sleeves of her
peignoir flew loose as she raised her arms, like a statuette
from Tanagra come to life.
</p>

<p>
Then she finished dressing, for she hated wrappers,
in which the body grows soft. She put on her apron,
and made tea in the samovar which Phil had given her,
just as he had given Suzanne a splendid salad-bowl.
Tea was Helia’s triumph, as Suzanne’s was salad; there
was no disputing it!
</p>

<p>
The concierge brought up the fresh bread, the butter,
and buns; and she cut her <i>tartines</i> thinking of other
things. She would put aside savings for Sœurette. She
would teach her; have her taught the piano—she
scarcely knew what—but not her own trade! The beginnings
were too hard; yet if it had not been for her
profession would she ever have known Phil? It would
have been better not, perhaps; who knows? She owed
him great joy—and grief as well! To think that he
had not come to see her first night at the <i>Cirque</i>!
</p>

<p>
The idea came to her that she might never live out
her love-romance to the end, and her heart swelled
within her. But with a gesture she put away these
haunting thoughts, and finished preparing the bread
and butter. When the breakfast was ready she awoke
her little sister.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_203' name='Page_203' href='#Page_203'>203</a></span>
</p>

<p>
“Up, and quickly, dear one! the tea is ready!”
</p>

<p>
Sœurette jumped from the bed, stuck her little feet
into her big sister’s slippers, and did not linger playing
on the carpet.
</p>

<p>
Seated on a chair made higher by a great book which
she would go to turning over presently, she already had
her nose in her cup. Her favorite doll, Glanrhyd, was
at Phil’s studio; he was to repaint the face, which had
been damaged by a fall. Other dolls were lying on the
floor, but they were not Glanrhyd! Glanrhyd had been
given her by Helia, who had cherished it ever since
her own childhood. In spite of its absence, Sœurette
was greatly preoccupied with her bread and butter and
tea. She had scarcely the time to smile at her big sister
and ask her questions.
</p>

<p>
“What is that—that medal?”
</p>

<p>
Helia had just been taking out of her trunk and
hanging on the wall mementos of her life, to which she
was much attached. Her little sister was not acquainted
with these objects.
</p>

<p>
“And that, and that?” Sœurette ran on, pointing
to a gilt-paper wreath, to a group of gymnasts with
Helia in the foreground, to still other things.
</p>

<p>
“And that?” she added, pointing to the photograph
of a young girl seated on a kind of throne with a
young man at her feet.
</p>

<p>
“It’s you and Phil!” Sœurette remarked.
</p>

<p>
“That might be,” answered Helia. “Eat in peace,
and keep quiet!”
</p>

<p>
“No; tell me first what that is?” Sœurette asked,
pointing to another photograph. “Barracks in a
garden?”
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_204' name='Page_204' href='#Page_204'>204</a></span>
</p>

<p>
“It’s not barracks, Sœurette; it’s the palace of the
Duchess of Glanrhyd, near London.”
</p>

<p>
“Is it the doll’s palace?”
</p>

<p>
“No,” Helia said; “but the duchess gave me the
doll.”
</p>

<p>
“Do you know the duchess?”
</p>

<p>
“When I was in England long ago I played in her
park at a benefit for the Society for the Protection of
Children and Prevention of Cruelty to the Weak.”
</p>

<p>
“Oh, what is that, tell me—the protection of children?”
Sœurette demanded.
</p>

<p>
“I can’t explain to you; you would not understand.”
</p>

<p>
Helia looked at the photograph and remembered the
day. “I will send you a pretty present,” the duchess
had said to her, caressing her with her gloved hand.
And, in fact, to Kennington Avenue, where Helia was
then living with Cemetery, they brought her a magnificent
doll and pounds of bonbons; but Helia enjoyed
neither them nor the doll.
</p>

<p>
“It will fatten you!” Cemetery said, as he locked
up the bonbons. “There is no strength in them.” He
put the doll in a cupboard, adding: “You have no time
to play, either, except on Sunday. Come, to work!”
</p>

<p>
“Say, big sister,” asked Sœurette, who was finishing
her bun, “what is cruelty to children? And is there
cruelty to big persons? Tell me!”
</p>

<p>
“Come and kiss me. You will know later on; and
now, go and play!”
</p>

<p>
“Say, big sister, Glanrhyd doesn’t come back. Must
I write to her?”
</p>

<p>
“Write if you wish, darling.”
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_205' name='Page_205' href='#Page_205'>205</a></span>
</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<a name="i-219" id="i-219"></a>
<img src="images/i-219.png" width="341" height="550" alt="" />
<p class="caption">“‘To whom shall I write?’”</p>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_206' name='Page_206' href='#Page_206'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_207' name='Page_207' href='#Page_207'>207</a></span>
</p>

<p>
This was quite an affair. Sœurette prepared her
table behind a screen in the “doll’s room”; but the
paper was too large—Glanrhyd would never be able
to read it. Helia had to cut it down to the proper
size. At last, having got seated, Sœurette, by way of
introduction, stuck out her tongue, rolled her head
from right to left, and began.
</p>

<p>
“Well, Sœurette is busy,” Helia said to herself.
“She will leave me a little peace.”
</p>

<p>
“Say, big sister, does a doll answer?”
</p>

<p>
“I don’t think so,” said Helia.
</p>

<p>
“Will Monsieur Phil answer?” Sœurette asked.
</p>

<p>
“Let Monsieur Phil alone. He has something else to
do!”
</p>

<p>
“But, big sister, it used to be always Phil here and
Phil there; you weren’t afraid to speak of him!”
</p>

<p>
“Well, I won’t have it!” Helia replied after a moment’s
silence.
</p>

<p>
“Why?”
</p>

<p>
“Because—”
</p>

<p>
“To whom shall I write, then?”
</p>

<p>
“I don’t know, my darling.”
</p>

<p>
Sœurette reflected for a moment, biting her penholder.
</p>

<p>
“How do you write ‘Little Jesus’—say? Is it one
word or two words?”
</p>

<p>
“Good!” thought Helia. “Now she’s writing to the
Little Jesus.”
</p>

<p>
But some one came to divert their attention. There
was a knock at the door, and Socrate came in with a
cheek red and limping slightly.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_208' name='Page_208' href='#Page_208'>208</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Helia asked what was the matter.
</p>

<p>
“Oh, last evening, after leaving you, I had a fall. It
is nothing,” Socrate hastened to say, not wishing to
tell of his affair with Phil; and for a good reason.
</p>

<p>
“You must have hit something hard,” Helia said.
</p>

<p>
“Oh!” Socrate went on, in a rage at his red cheek
and limping leg, “oh, why are you always spoiling
that little girl? Cakes and dolls! Cakes only fatten
her, and dolls are good only for Sunday!”
</p>

<p>
Helia was struck by the remark which brought back
word for word Cemetery’s observations. It was of no
importance, of course; it was one of Socrate’s jokes—the
proof was that he was smiling. But it displeased
Helia, who had become very reserved with him, and
distrusted him a little. She esteemed him only for
the nature of his work. It seemed to Helia that by
taking interest in an “intelligence” she redeemed in
some way the roughness of her trade as a gymnast. She
raised herself in her own eyes. So she helped Socrate,
half through charity and half out of pride.
</p>

<p>
Socrate, knowing Helia’s goodness, looked forward
to the time when he should have supplanted in her heart
the remembrance of Phil. But he soon discovered
Helia’s real feelings, and was all the angrier because he
had to hide his wrath. When he described to her the
plan of his next poem, or the picture that he was always
“going to do,” he was thinking all the while of
other things than his pictures and poems.
</p>

<p>
What! He was not to be the husband of Helia?
She was to marry some one else? And he, Socrate,
would not have the signing of contracts with her directors,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_209' name='Page_209' href='#Page_209'>209</a></span>
the discussing of prices, and the pocketing of the
money? Some one else was to enjoy all that?
</p>

<p>
What a pleasant life his would be if he should marry
Helia! Oh, it was very simple. First of all, he’d
set Sœurette to work, steady! They might give her
bonbons and dolls; they would all go under lock and
key, and then—to work! In the morning, while he
would go to the café and take his eye-opener, Helia
and the little one would do their dumb-bells, to get
under way for rehearsal. And then—<i>ouste!</i>—three
hours’ exercise in the morning, and three in the afternoon.
Then he would show what was in him! He
would encourage with a gesture or threaten with a
look; sometimes he might let fall a “Very good” for
Helia, or “It doesn’t go; begin again!” for the little
one. In his conception of himself as professor he had
always a cigar between his teeth, diamond buttons on
his cuffs turned up to the elbows, and all around him
papers and notices talking of the glory of this wife
of his—the star.
</p>

<p>
To think that he was not to be Helia’s husband! The
very idea made him turn over in his head all sorts of
sinister projects.
</p>

<p>
Socrate tried to be friendly with Sœurette.
</p>

<p>
“Good day, Mlle. Princesse! Will you kiss me, Mlle.
Princesse?”
</p>

<p>
“No!” Sœurette answered. “Your red cheek makes
me afraid. You look like a bogy man!”
</p>

<p>
“Now, now, Sœurette!” Helia said. “Be polite, darling.
M. Socrate fell down; it wasn’t his fault. Don’t
you know that poets walk along looking at the stars?”
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_210' name='Page_210' href='#Page_210'>210</a></span>
</p>

<p>
“Not at the stars, but at one star, Mlle. Helia. You
know the one I mean!”
</p>

<p>
“Now you are here, Socrate, you can do me a favor,”
Helia interrupted, not even listening to his compliments.
“First, throw these letters for me into the
waste-basket.”
</p>

<p>
“Must I throw that of Mlle. la Princesse also? What
is she writing there? Can I see?”
</p>

<p>
“No!” Sœurette answered.
</p>

<p>
“Is it a secret? Well, I won’t insist,” Socrate said,
and straightway stretched his neck over the screen and
read:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
“To the Little Jesus: They say, Little Jesus, that up there in
heaven you have a wonderful bazaar, with all the playthings
which are in all the earth and some that are not. There is no
doubt of it, Little Jesus, is there? Well, then, cure Glanrhyd
and send me a little white dog—a curly one that barks. I’d
like to have a doll dressed for her wedding, and a little china
table service; and let it be pretty—very, very pretty!”
</p>
</div>

<p>
“A letter to Little Jesus?” Socrate thought to himself.
“There’s a letter which won’t be delivered!”
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile Helia was reading her morning’s mail.
There was nothing new in it; she had received hundreds
of such letters. “Mademoiselle, pardon me, if I dare—”
“Mademoiselle, will you allow an admirer of your talent
and your beauty—” And so on, and so forth.
</p>

<p>
Helia did not even read them through to the end.
She blushed, not with shame, but with pity for such
foolish adorers.
</p>

<p>
“Do they take me for a toy? Into the basket!” And
she held out the letters to Socrate.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_211' name='Page_211' href='#Page_211'>211</a></span>
</p>

<p>
“Why, she is crazy!” Socrate thought. “All these
letters—they’d be magnificent for blackmailing!”
</p>

<p>
“You do wrong to destroy them!” Socrate said aloud.
“Some of them are, perhaps, in earnest.”
</p>

<p>
“How is that?” Helia said, looking at him. “What
do you mean?”
</p>

<p>
“I—why—”
</p>

<p>
Helia’s uprightness disarmed him. She would never
understand anything! Was it possible to be so naïve?
Socrate was exasperated by it.
</p>

<p>
“By dint of shutting yourself out from everybody,
you’ll soon have no more friends,” he said, trying to be
insinuating. “Who knows if there’s not a letter from
the duke there?”
</p>

<p>
“And what then?” Helia said, as she arose.
</p>

<p>
“He is, perhaps, your best friend,” Socrate answered.
“A powerful protector like him—”
</p>

<p>
“What!”
</p>

<p>
“Of course, next to Monsieur Phil,” he went on, with
the perspiration starting out on his forehead. “But
Monsieur Phil is too busy! They say, even—” And
Socrate hunted for a word with which to end his embarrassment,
and he had to be inventive and prompt.
</p>

<p>
“What is it they say?” Helia asked.
</p>

<p>
“That he is going to marry.”
</p>

<p>
Helia had too great a habit of controlling her nerves,
too much mastery of herself, and too much pride, to
show her pain. Socrate had not the pleasure of seeing
her turn pale. She appeared to be taken up with Sœurette,
in her corner.
</p>

<p>
“Of course,” was Helia’s reply. “And now do this
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_212' name='Page_212' href='#Page_212'>212</a></span>
errand for me, will you, Socrate? Here is the money,”
she added, explaining what she wished. “Pay—and
keep what’s left over.”
</p>

<p>
She accompanied him to the door. Her limbs were
trembling and she seemed to walk on cotton. There
was a roaring in her ears. She turned and fell into a
chair.
</p>

<p>
Phil was to marry! Everything seemed crumbling
around her, her dreams for the future, her castles in
Spain, burying her in their ruins. Ah, she could never
recover from such a blow! In vain had she been long
awaiting it; she would never have believed it possible
that Phil, so gentle and good, would do her such harm!
For him, too, she had, then, been but a toy! He had
amused himself with her! He had sworn marriage to
her, and because she was poor and needed to work,—at a
trade which she had not chosen, oh, no!—because she
earned her living in a circus, they had the right to look
down on her! So she belonged to the public! They
could buy a ticket at the door and talk love to her between
the acts for a pastime, while oaths—yes, oaths taking
Heaven for witness, the oaths which were sworn to
her—did not count!
</p>

<p>
Helia pronounced the last words aloud in a tone of
indignation. Sœurette looked up. She saw her big sister
put her head in her hands and weep silently.
</p>

<p>
For some time she had found that her sister was no
longer the same. Her child’s memory recalled to her
a Helia full of joy and talking always of Phil; a Helia
who drew a circle with her pen at the end of her letters,
after applying her lips to the spot; a Helia who told
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_213' name='Page_213' href='#Page_213'>213</a></span>
her beautiful stories and played and danced her in her
arms, which were so firm and gentle that she would
have cast herself into them from a belfry with closed
eyes.
</p>

<p>
Sœurette tried to understand. Her little brain divined
something without knowing exactly what. First, they did
not often see Monsieur Phil. He was always very kind to
her, Monsieur Phil,—and yet every time her big sister
saw him she was sad afterward. Why? Socrate, too,
made Helia sad. She was in trouble when he went away.
What had he been saying to her? And Phil, especially,
what had he been doing to her big sister?
</p>

<p>
Helia raised her head. She was as worn out as after
her most violent efforts. The suffering calmed her revolted
pride. Sœurette saw her lie back in her chair
and close her eyes as if to sleep. But Helia did not
sleep. During those moments she saw again her entire
life—the gloomy childhood in which she could count her
happy days, and then her youth, in which Phil had
loved her. Had she acted wrongly? What had she
done that could displease him? Perhaps it was a mistake
to keep on in her trade; but how was she to live?
Phil was to have taken her out of it, and he had not
done so. And she meanwhile had been so proud to be
an artiste, believing that she would become his equal,
poor fool that she had been! Yes, it must be that!
Phil, the student, was her equal: the Phil who was
now tasting glory was not. Then that other young
girl had come, so beautiful and good and rich, everybody
said; and surely amiable, and smelling of violets!
</p>

<p>
“No! no! no! It is not possible!” Helia murmured
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_214' name='Page_214' href='#Page_214'>214</a></span>
as she sat upright in her chair. “No! I know Phil—he
is a man! If he had done that, he would turn
away his head when he sees me, or he would come to
ask my forgiveness on his knees. But after the oath
which he had sworn me, to act like that—without shame
and without remorse—no! Socrate is lying!”
</p>

<p>
Sœurette said nothing. Her instinct told her that all
this did not concern her; that her business was to keep
quiet, and that big sisters have cares which she could
not understand. But she saw that Helia was in trouble,
in great trouble; and Sœurette wished to see her full
of joy, as she had once been. Her good little heart
had a touching inspiration. She drew a mark across
her letter and ended it up as follows:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
“Little Jesus, keep your playthings for the poor, but tell Phil
to be good to my big sister, who used to play all the while and
tell me stories. Make him to be not so wicked, for she cries
often when she speaks about him. I put my kiss here for you,
Little Jesus.”
</p>
</div>

<p>
And Sœurette did as she had seen Helia do: before
slipping the letter into the envelop she placed a kiss at
the end of it, and made a circle with her pen all around
the spot.

<h3>
CHAPTER VI
<br />
THE OLD, OLD STORY
</h3>

<p>
An automobile, with Miss Rowrer’s brother Will conducting
it himself, was rolling slowly along. Will
had just arrived from America, to rest in France
from the worries of business. He had bought for his
sister this magnificent “forty-horse-power” machine;
and, with a chauffeur to indicate the way for him, he
had the pleasure of taking Ethel and grandma for a ride
through Paris. That day, on the seats behind him,
there were his sister and grandma, and, facing them, the
Duke of Morgania alone.
</p>

<p>
“Oh, there’s Monsieur Phil!” Miss Rowrer said, as
the auto stopped at a crossing thronged with hucksters
and good-wives in morning undress.
</p>

<p>
“Good day, Monsieur Phil!”
</p>

<p>
Phil was on the sidewalk, two steps from Miss Rowrer.
He was in his studio dress, a short coat over his sweater.
He had come out to buy something and was going home
with a package done up in paper in his hand. Hearing
his name, he raised his head, recognized Miss Rowrer,
bowed, and then approached in visible embarrassment.
The vizor of his cap ill concealed the eye which Socrate
had chanced to blacken with his fist the night before.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_216' name='Page_216' href='#Page_216'>216</a></span>
</p>

<p>
“Our friend Phil does his own marketing,” Ethel said,
laughing. “He is right. I’ve heard from the Hon.
Mr. Charley that nothing is equal to a good beefsteak
as a plaster for a black eye.”
</p>

<p>
“Well, I suppose I must tell you,” said Phil, not
wishing that Miss Rowrer should think he had fought
with a lamp-post. “This is how it happened: I got
it last night while punishing a rough fellow for ill-treating
a poor dog.”
</p>

<p>
“Really? Then get in here with us, I beg of you,”
said Ethel.
</p>

<p>
Phil excused himself,—his dress, his black eye.
</p>

<p>
“You’re all right as you are,” Ethel replied. “You’ll
really oblige me by coming with us”—and she seated
him beside the duke.
</p>

<p>
“Your dress doesn’t trouble us, since it pleases you,”
she continued. “Be yourself, and look out at the world
from the neck of a sweater—there’ll always be people
enough to look loftily over a choker. If I were a man
I would always defend the weak and pay no attention
to the rest. You’re all right as you are, Monsieur Phil.”
</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<a name="i-231" id="i-231"></a>
<img src="images/i-231.png" width="356" height="550" alt="" />
<p class="caption">“He approached in visible embarrassment”</p>
</div>

<p>
Phil listened to Ethel with intense satisfaction. The
duke chatted with grandma. The good-fellowship which
he saw growing up between Miss Rowrer and Phil did
not bother him. It was only the ordinary relations between
an American girl and boy—only the friendship
of fellow country people. The duke had for Phil that
distant regard which nobles by race have for professionals.
To handle a tool, even such as the painter’s
brush or sculptor’s chisel,—to do something with one’s
hands, be it even a masterpiece,—lowers a man somewhat
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_217' name='Page_217' href='#Page_217'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_218' name='Page_218' href='#Page_218'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_219' name='Page_219' href='#Page_219'>219</a></span>
in their consideration. Consequently Phil might
defend strong or weak, or dog-martyrs, if it amused
him—it was a matter of no importance. The duke
gave himself up to the noble occupation of a cicerone
of mark, who knew his Paris thoroughly; and, as
they passed, he pointed out the monuments to grandma.
</p>

<p>
Phil, on his side, talked with Ethel <i>en camarade</i>, as the
duke said. What a pleasure such talks were to him!
Where were now his fine resolutions no longer to make
himself the champion of Miss Rowrer, and even to stop
seeing her? He drifted along under the charm of her
words. From the day when, in the duke’s company, he
had first met her at the Comtesse de Donjeon’s, he had
become one of the faithful at her tea-parties. He often
went to the Rue Servandoni; and, after the commission
for the empress’s portrait and Ethel’s entrance as a
pupil in his studio, they had had the most friendly
relations.
</p>

<p>
Phil told her stories from bohemia that amused her.
He narrated his adventures in the provinces, including
the little Saint John, with his arrival in Paris and his
visit to Poufaille and Suzanne; the “comrades,” and
Socrate, and the Deux-Magots; his reception at the studio;
and the welcome on the model’s table; and many
other things besides. But he said little about Helia’s
stay in Paris when he was a student. For that matter,
he thought of it seldom; his memory was a mist concerning
it—it all seemed so far away to him.
</p>

<p>
With what pity he recalled the environment in which
he had lived! There were all his chance friends. Suzanne,
who was really good, and skeptical only because
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_220' name='Page_220' href='#Page_220'>220</a></span>
she had seen too early the bad side of life. Poufaille was
too simple; to have made an intimate friend of him
would have been to tie a cannon-ball to one’s leg. Charley
was too much of a bluffer. As to Helia—ah, Helia!
He was grateful to her from the bottom of his heart
for the simple love which he had once had for her—a
love whose remembrance had protected him all through
his first years in Paris. For him it had been a romance,
without reproach, candid and loyal, and not a
passion that would follow him through life like a remorse.
His romance—Phil was sure of it—had nothing in it that
was not noble. Yes, Helia would always have a place
apart in his heart; she would be a sweet memory. Forever,
all through his life, she would be his friend and
he would forever be a brother to her.
</p>

<p>
But time had passed. Helia herself had changed. He
saw it clearly during her visit to him in his studio on
the morrow of the Quat’z-Arts Ball. Ah, how far away
were the days when she had been his sweetheart—how
many things had passed since then! Now Ethel ruled
in his life. He felt himself very little in her presence.
For her he had the same admiration which Helia once
had for him.
</p>

<p>
Miss Rowrer was the first society girl whom he had
known; for he had led a solitary life in the Chesapeake
manor, and in Europe his over-timidity had always
held him socially aloof. During his years as a student
he had neither opportunity nor leisure. It was only now
that he began to understand the charm of the social
world. The instincts of his good breeding were awakened.
Life seemed beginning for him; he felt like a man back
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_221' name='Page_221' href='#Page_221'>221</a></span>
from exile. Contact with Miss Rowrer refined him, and
even his art was idealized. It was no longer physical
beauty alone which attracted him: there was the moral
side; for Ethel put character far above talent, and the
two together above everything else.
</p>

<p>
After this automobile ride which his black eye had
earned for him, others followed. Usually Will, the brother,
was himself the conductor, as a matter of prudence.
That intoxication of speed which gives weak minds the
illusion of energy was unknown to him. Once, however,
he got into the auto with them and allowed the mechanician
to take charge. It was a day when Mme. de Grojean
and Mlle. Yvonne, her daughter, had accepted the
invitation to take a ride with them. After that Mlle.
Yvonne and her mother returned to their province, so
that the most part of the time Ethel and grandma had
the company only of the duke or Phil, and now and then
of M. Caracal.
</p>

<p>
They saw Auteuil and Chantilly, and took part in an
automobile gymkhana for polo at the Bois de Boulogne.
At the Longchamps races Miss Rowrer, like a great favorite,
was the target of the field-glasses. It was there she
met Charley, faultlessly correct, having stripped himself
for the day of his bohemian clothes. Charley, who knew
Ethel, passed in vain near her again and again to have
her recognize him.
</p>

<p>
The automobilists were seen everywhere from Versailles
to Vincennes. The trip around the world was too
commonplace. They made the trip around Paris, passing
its fifty-seven gates, past its ten railways, its two waterways,
through its two forests and more than thirty <i>quartiers</i>,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_222' name='Page_222' href='#Page_222'>222</a></span>
which sum up the luxury and industries of all the
cities of the world—London at La Râpée, Chicago at
La Villette, Antwerp at the Canal de l’Ourcq.
</p>

<p>
At St. Denis Caracal gave them the history of what
they were seeing. He showed them the effigies of kings
mutilated in the Revolution, at the time when Choisy-le-Roi
changed its name to Choisy-sur-Seine and Montmorency
to Etienne, since there were no longer kings or
nobles—“two things they would have done better to
keep,” the duke observed.
</p>

<p>
“They would probably still be here if they had been
worth keeping,” answered Ethel.
</p>

<p>
They dined in a tree at Robinson and rode on donkeys
at Romainville. The outings of Parisians in villages
with charming names—Marne-la-Coquette, Fontenay-aux-Roses,
Les Lilas—were pleasing to Ethel.
</p>

<p>
“Space opens up ideas! You will find it so, Monsieur
le Duc, and you too, Phil, if you do us the pleasure to
hunt the moose on our Canadian lands. How free one
feels there—not a hedge, not a barrier between us and
the north pole!”
</p>

<p>
Caracal, for his part, cared little about space. He
regretted the days when the Boulevard was the only
promenade. Tramways and railroads seemed to him high
treason against Paris—something like an invasion of the
coarse air of fields and woods into the artistic atmosphere
of cafés.
</p>

<p>
“No, no!” Miss Rowrer answered. “Leave things as
they are—a little pure air does no harm.”
</p>

<p>
“To be sure!” said grandma.
</p>

<p>
Caracal refused to be consoled.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_223' name='Page_223' href='#Page_223'>223</a></span>
</p>

<p>
“If this goes on,” he said, “Paris will soon be Paris
no longer—that something indefinable and apart; that
hothouse which has made us the neurasthenic and dislocated
skipjacks that we are.”
</p>

<p>
“Well, if that’s your manner of loving Paris!” Ethel
said, laughing. “Really, you see things worse than they
are!”
</p>

<p>
Caracal, perceiving he was on the wrong tack, stopped
short.
</p>

<p>
“Just the contrary, you ought to be glad for something
that is worth more than hygiene—moral health,”
Miss Rowrer continued. “Why should people stay piled
together when there is so much empty space around?
Tempers are embittered and bodies weakened. Give it
space and air and your Paris will cease to be what you
would wish it to remain—a hothouse full of dislocated
skipjacks and <i>neurasthéniques</i>—such as our up-to-date
people are, according to you.”
</p>

<p>
“That’s a good one on Caracal,” thought Phil to himself.
</p>

<p>
Will, who was not conducting the auto that day, interrupted
Ethel. He spoke little, but he thought and then
went straight to the point.
</p>

<p>
“Let us pardon Frenchmen because of Frenchwomen,”
he said.
</p>

<p>
“You are right, Will,” replied Ethel. “I admire
Frenchwomen—they seem so superior to the men; for
among the men there are some so mean. Think of Vieillecloche
printing such outrageous things in his newspaper!
Really, in his place I should be ashamed of myself!
Who is Vieillecloche, anyway?”
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_224' name='Page_224' href='#Page_224'>224</a></span>
</p>

<p>
“He’s a remarkable duelist,” answered Caracal.
“There are already five dead men in his trail.”
</p>

<p>
“What a coward!” said Ethel. “I would wager that
if he were hit with a check, he would apologize to us!”
</p>

<p>
“Oh, let him alone!” said Will. “He does us no
harm—the barking dog doesn’t bite.”
</p>

<p>
“He’s annoying, all the same.”
</p>

<p>
“If it were my own case I would silence him!” Caracal
declared.
</p>

<p>
“But could you do it?” asked Ethel. “It would be
very kind of you to do so. I can’t go anywhere at all
without hearing ‘Richard the Lion-hearted’ with smiles
all around me. It haunts me. It almost spoils my stay
in Paris. Can you rid me of it, Monsieur Caracal?”
</p>

<p>
“I shall do so!” declared Caracal.
</p>

<p>
“I thank you!” said Miss Rowrer.
</p>

<p>
Caracal had just had a bright thought. He knew his
friend Vieillecloche would do whatever he wished, since
the blackmailing scheme against the Rowrers had not
succeeded and no check had come or would come to close
his mouth. It would be just as well to look for something
else. Caracal would have himself attacked—he would
turn aside the storm to himself by taking up the defense
of foreigners, to the apparent indignation of Vieillecloche.
In this noble combat against calumny he would stand
forth as a hero in the eyes of Ethel, like a St. George
slaying the dragon. The duke and Phil would have to
look out for themselves. He would know how to cover
them with ridicule—them and their Helia—in some good
little newspaper <i>chronique</i>, sweet as honey, which Ethel
might read. For that matter, Phil had already a shot in
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_225' name='Page_225' href='#Page_225'>225</a></span>
his wing—he would find it out in a few days and remember
his cow painting!
</p>

<p>
“I will arrange all that this evening with Vieillecloche,”
thought Caracal. “I shall be well able to pay
for a service like that if I marry Miss Ethel.” Then
aloud: “I shall do so—you can count on me, Miss
Rowrer!”
</p>

<p>
All this was but one of a thousand incidents of their
trips.
</p>

<p>
“I have heard of <i>le dernier salon où l’on cause</i> [the
last salon for conversation],” Ethel remarked. “I suppose
it has disappeared, it is so long since people began
talking about it. Well, our auto takes its place—it is the
first auto <i>où l’on cause</i>.”
</p>

<p>
“When one listens to you, Miss Rowrer, one can say
that wit runs the streets,” added Caracal, gallantly.
</p>

<p>
Every moment some new observation sprang, bringing
out individual character.
</p>

<p>
For instance, a cab passed them noisily, the horse
pounding along the street and the driver lashing him.
</p>

<p>
“What a noise!” Will said. “Why are people so obstinate
with their hippomobiles? Why not put rubber on
the wheels first, and then on the horses’ shoes?”
</p>

<p>
Will calculated the chances of a company to be organized
for this purpose—so many horses in Europe, so
many horseshoes rubbered, investment of capital so much,
revenue so much.
</p>

<p>
“They are ’way behind,” said grandma. “What an
idea, to be driven about in such dust-boxes!”
</p>

<p>
“What a picture to make!” said Phil. “That horse
just now reared under the rein with a movement as
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_226' name='Page_226' href='#Page_226'>226</a></span>
superb as any of the Parthenon. Behind him was that
theatrical poster representing a woman with her hair
floating—with her and the horse you might imagine a
troupe of Amazons under the blue sky of Greece! Only
artists can enjoy things. They know how to see!”
</p>

<p>
“The poor beast has lost a shoe, and the collar wounds
him and the cabman lashes him,” Ethel interrupted.
“Poor animal, it makes me ill to see him!”
</p>

<p>
Phil thought to himself, “That is what I ought to have
seen!”
</p>

<p>
Apart from these excursions, he gave to Miss Rowrer,
also, whatever leisure was left him by his great picture
of Morgana. At her request, he accompanied her with
Will and grandma in their visits to museums and to the
shops where they wished to buy pictures of the masters
for their palace on the Lake Shore Drive in Chicago.
</p>

<p>
Will had first visited the artists’ studios, thinking he
would find there a world free from the atmosphere of
business. But the landscape man tried to get him away
from the portrait-painter, and professional jealousy
showed its teeth. They tried to pass off their “old stock”
on him; they spoke only of money. “For such a price
I will do so and so.” “If it is larger it will be dearer.”
“A landscape without trees is worth so much—with trees,
twice as much!”
</p>

<p>
“If I’ve got to talk business,” Will thought, “I’d
rather do it with business men”; and he left the artists
alone.
</p>

<p class="caption">Poufaille’s Goods Ready for Auction</p>
</div>

<p>
He liked best to choose for himself at the Hôtel
Drouot—that big collecting-sewer of art, rolling pell-mell
in its dusty waves masterpieces and daubs. The salesrooms,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_227' name='Page_227' href='#Page_227'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_228' name='Page_228' href='#Page_228'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_229' name='Page_229' href='#Page_229'>229</a></span>
heaped from ceiling to floor, gave him the feeling
that he might sometime make a discovery there like the
cock who found pearls in a dunghill.
</p>

<p>
“What horrors!” Will said one day, as they were passing
in front of a hall full of plaster statues and unframed
paintings. “It must be from the studio of some
poor devil whom they are selling out at auction.”
</p>

<p>
There were casts from nature—arms and legs and feet;
there were formless sketches, canvases hung on the wall;
for some, it was impossible to see what they represented,
as they had been hung head downward. There was a tub,
some bottles, a few chairs, a mattress, and a rickety
table, all heaped up in a corner. Two monstrous statues
seemed to keep watch over the confusion. On the pedestal
of one was inscribed “Liberty,” and she raised
arms and head furiously; the second, “Fraternity,” lay
on the ground in fragments, turning enormous haunches
to the public.
</p>

<p>
“What are those mastodons there?” Will asked.
</p>

<p>
“That,” said Phil, with surprise, “that must be from
a sculptor whose name is Poufaille; yes, look at the sign
over the door—<i>Vente Poufaille</i>.”
</p>

<p>
“Poor Poufaille!” said Phil to himself; “he must
have been unable to pay his rent—the landlord has come
down on him. If I had known, I might have helped; but
it is so long since I have seen him.”
</p>

<p>
What he saw recalled the day when he entered the
sculptor’s place on his arrival in Paris. He remembered
the gay laughter of Suzanne from the top of her ladder,
and the pork fried with garlic. Those statues, those
pictures worthy to figure in a collection of horrors,—how
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_230' name='Page_230' href='#Page_230'>230</a></span>
much more ugly and more lamentable still it all seemed
to him in the presence of the crowd of indifferent passers-by!
</p>

<p>
“Poufaille?” Ethel asked with interest. “Is it the
Poufaille of whom you used to tell me? Why, he has
no talent; he’d do better as a farmer.”
</p>

<p>
The sale began and they heard the auctioneer above
the confusion of the throng: “Magnificent statues—‘Liberty’—‘Fraternity’—give
me a bid!”
</p>

<p>
“Forty sous!”
</p>

<p>
“Forty sous? There’s half a ton of plaster there!
Come, now, a higher bid!”
</p>

<p>
A silence, and then some one called, “Fifty sous!”
</p>

<p>
“Bid it up a thousand francs, Will!” Ethel said to
her brother.
</p>

<p>
“Really, now, Ethel,” Will answered, “even at fifty
sous it’s dear. I’ll buy something else from M. Poufaille,
some other time.”
</p>

<p>
So many years of toil and want, and all his poor dreams
of the future soon to be scattered and ground to mortar—yet
Poufaille was right! He had followed his dream,
he had tried his fortune; it had tumbled to the ground,
but what a beautiful dream it had been all the same!
And Phil thought, with a thrill at his heart, that there
was one thing which justified every effort; one thing
which broke down distinctions and made a poor artist
the equal of a reigning duke, of a king even; something
which would put him on a level with Ethel; something
which he would reach, had he to kill himself in the
struggle for it!
</p>

<p>
Ethel came up to Phil as they were going out of the
hall.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_231' name='Page_231' href='#Page_231'>231</a></span>
</p>

<p>
“Tell me, Phil, what can induce a man like Poufaille
to try art? Isn’t it sheer folly?”
</p>

<p>
“No, Miss Rowrer. It is true Poufaille has not succeeded,
but that matters little. He has tried to reach
the only thing which makes life worth living.”
</p>

<p>
“What is that, Phil?”
</p>

<p>
“Fame!”

CHAPTER VII
<br />
CARACAL’S NARROW ESCAPE
</h3>

<p>
“À bas Caracal!”
</p>

<p>
“Vive Vieillecloche!”
</p>

<p>
Phil, who was reading a newspaper as he passed
along, looked up with astonishment.
</p>

<p>
He was in front of the entrance of a music-hall. On
a strip of cotton cloth he read, in huge letters, “PUNCH
d’INDIGNATION!” The name of Vieillecloche was
displayed everywhere, mingled with the flags which covered
a good half of the theatrical posters of acrobats,
jugglers, and clowns.
</p>

<p>
“The flag covers the goods!” Phil said, as he saw this
assemblage of patriotism and fakery. “Vieillecloche is
at his old tricks; what a humbug!”
</p>

<p>
Phil stopped. Confused imprecations against impostors
and grafters came to his ears between the bang!
bang! of the door, pushed one way or the other by the
public and clanging back into its place.
</p>

<p>
Bang! “Vive Vieillecloche!”
</p>

<p>
Bang! “À bas!” Bang! “Traitors! Sold out!”
Bang! “À bas Caracal!” Bang! bang!
</p>

<p>
“Hello!” said Phil. “‘À bas Caracal’? What does
that mean? I must go in.”
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_233' name='Page_233' href='#Page_233'>233</a></span>
</p>

<p>
He entered.
</p>

<p>
Bang! It was the door slamming after Phil. He
had now a right to the indignation and to the punch.
</p>

<p>
To tell the truth, there was little indignation in the
hall, but a great deal of drinking and still more laughter.
The public was made up of the idlers of the quarter, who
had come to be amused. There were stable-boys and
grooms in their great wooden shoes. The hall was infected
with the smell of rum and tobacco. The voices,
which but now had reached Phil’s ear in broken cries,
rolled uninterruptedly. There was a continuous torrent
of <i>à bas!</i> and <i>vive!</i> mingled with coarse wit and the clink
of glasses. On the stage, mastering the tumult, Vieillecloche
was speaking.
</p>

<p>
“Vive Vieillecloche!”
</p>

<p>
“Hear! hear!”
</p>

<p>
Bang!
</p>

<p>
The flights of oratory were lost amid the noise.
</p>

<p>
“Only yesterday,” Vieillecloche was saying, as he
raised his voice, “not satisfied with attacking the majesty
of universal suffrage, forgetful of the famous night of the
13th of March, foreigners feared not to brave the lion-people
in its den! They banded together to despoil us
of our dead—to soil the majesty of the tomb where our
great ancestors—” Bang! said the door, cutting the discourse,
“—ancestors sleep their eternal sleep! Do you
not hear, O people, beneath the earth Richard the Lion-hearted
roaring with wrath and shame? And to think
there are French pens that treat us as visionaries—us
who point out such attacks—and that pretend that we
are wanting in courtesy by accusing our passing guests
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_234' name='Page_234' href='#Page_234'>234</a></span>
of an imaginary crime! This vile pen, citizens, I deliver
it up to your indignant scorn. It is Caracal!”
</p>

<p>
“À bas Caracal!”
</p>

<p>
“Oho! I understand,” Phil said to himself. “Caracal
has taken up the defense of the foreigners, as he
promised Miss Rowrer the other day.”
</p>

<p>
“Eh bien!” Vieillecloche went on, “it shall not be
said that Caracal has appealed in vain to our courtesy
when he asks us to cease our political campaign against
such foreigners, among whom there are ladies and even
a young girl. We shall speak no more of Richard the
Lion-hearted! All that is a blunder, a visionary’s
dream, a groundless accusation. So be it! They ask for
definite facts and not for vague accusations. Here is a
definite fact! I accuse, formally, an American of stealing
our ideas and stifling under the power of his cursed
gold the outburst of a young genius, the hope of our
glorious national art. They come to pillage even in their
calm retreats, and to deprive of their labor the sons of
the soil—<i>les autochtones!</i>—hum!—<i>les autochtones!</i>” (The
word intoxicated Vieillecloche and he sent it bounding
like a rubber ball.) “Yes, citizens! He has signed
his work with a false name, he has picked the lock
of our national museums, and, like a cuckoo, he has
deposited in the bosom of glory the egg which he has not
laid! And you suffer that, O people? Do you not feel
the blush of shame mounting to your cheek? Take your
clubs, Parisians—” and so he went on and on.
</p>

<p>
Vieillecloche in his haranguing embroidered his theme
with violent gestures which sent the skirts of his coat
flying around his thin body.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_235' name='Page_235' href='#Page_235'>235</a></span>

<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_237' name='Page_237' href='#Page_237'>237</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Phil was not sorry to have come. The inventions of
this crank amused him, most of all when the orator, rising
to higher flights, brought out personal facts so as “to
enter into the domain of practical things.” Vieillecloche
calmed down. The storm-tossed skirts of his coat fell.
He was no longer the roaring tribune of the people: he
was the statesman, speaking calmly and coolly. He held
one hand between the buttons of his waistcoat, and the
other behind his back, like Napoleon. To begin with,
according to him, these facts would never have taken
place if they had only listened to him.
</p>

<p>
A quarter of an hour of counsels followed, in which
there were insurrections and barricades, blood and glory,
and <i>à bas!</i> and <i>vive!</i>
</p>

<p>
“But if the sword remains in the scabbard,” Vieillecloche
concluded, “let the people, at least, console despoiled
genius with their songs; let the old Gaulish gaiety
inflict its avenging laugh on the robber of its glory!”
</p>

<p>
As Vieillecloche retired amid ironic applause, a long-haired
poet came out on the platform and a hurdy-gurdy
ground out despairingly such an air as goats dance to.
Phil looked at the furious grinder and gave a cry of
astonishment: “Poufaille!”
</p>

<p>
“What is Poufaille doing here? And why does he
look so furious?” Phil asked himself, as he saw the sculptor’s
wrathful head leaning over the hurdy-gurdy whose
crank he turned with rage.
</p>

<p>
Bing! bing!
</p>

<p>
“After all,” thought Phil, “there is nothing strange
in Poufaille being here. Artists belong to all sorts of
provincial and Parisian societies, as if they were really
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_238' name='Page_238' href='#Page_238'>238</a></span>
children of the soil, so as to get orders. He might as
well grind out a tune at an indignation meeting as
Suzanne do the Muse of the South at the Pig’s-Rump
Dinner.”
</p>

<p>
Phil also knew that the “Poets of the Landes” or the
“Broom-flower” were only too happy to make themselves
heard by a Parisian public, and would not miss an
occasion for avenging genius despoiled by cowards, and
for declaiming in its honor to the accompaniment of
a hurdy-gurdy or bagpipes.
</p>

<p>
So it was a very simple thing that Poufaille should
have offered his services. Meanwhile Vieillecloche had sat
down after many a handshake with the notabilities of
the committee. It was now the turn of the poet.
</p>

<p>
The singer on the platform gesticulated to his Norman
patois, more monotonous than the fall of rain, while the
air of the hurdy-gurdy, piercing and thrilling, filled the
hall like a continued wailing from a herd of kids.
</p>

<p>
“Enough!” cried the public; “be done, <i>fouchtri!</i>”
</p>

<p>
“To the door!”
</p>

<p>
“Enough! enough!”
</p>

<p>
“Silence, François!”
</p>

<p>
“Ta bouche, bébé!”
</p>

<p>
“Stow it! I say! <i>pétrusquin!</i>”
</p>

<p>
It was the <i>Parigot</i> wit replying to the wit of the provinces.
The people had indeed arisen, but not as Vieillecloche
would have wished. Instead of tearing up the
paving-stones in honor of misunderstood Genius, and
casting out the robbers of Glory, they were content to
finish the punch and laugh in the face of the poet who
bored them with his doggerel.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_239' name='Page_239' href='#Page_239'>239</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Besides, all these questions of signatures to pictures, of
museum locks picked, and of Richard the Lion-hearted
interested nobody.
</p>

<p>
But the banging of the door now began covering the
bing! bing! of the tune. The public was going out in a
mass. Vieillecloche tried to keep them by new flights of
oratory which had no echo. Phil foresaw that the fierce
tribune of the people would soon be making his prophetic
gestures and proclaiming the eternal glory of the <i>autochtones</i>
alone with his hurdy-gurdy, like St. Anthony
with his pig. So Phil went away, followed to the very
street by the exasperated grinding of the crank.
</p>

<p>
“What madness!” Phil said to himself. “Poufaille
is certainly earning his money. He puts as much heat
into it as if some one had stolen his own share of glory.”
Poufaille a despoiled young genius! Phil, at the very
idea, could not refrain from laughter.
</p>

<p>
“I must wait for him here,” he thought; “I shall see
him when he comes out.”
</p>

<p>
He walked back and forth, but Poufaille did not come
out. Still, Phil lost nothing by waiting. A final bang
of the door made him turn his head and—what did he
see but, arm in arm and laughing and talking together
as gay as school-boys, Vieillecloche with Caracal!
</p>

<p>
“Well, I never! That’s too much!” Phil said, as he
followed them with his eyes, trying to gather from their
gestures the meaning of their conversation.
</p>

<p>
Vieillecloche lifted his hands, as if to show that they
were empty. Caracal spoke low to him. Vieillecloche
nodded approvingly.
</p>

<p>
“Those fine fellows must be preparing some stroke of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_240' name='Page_240' href='#Page_240'>240</a></span>
business,” Phil said to himself, strongly interested.
“Who knows if I do not play a part in it? It may be
my turn—and Miss Ethel will no longer hear of Richard
the Lion-hearted. The attacks will now fall on Caracal.
Bravo! But perhaps Miss Ethel will not be displeased
to learn of the friendship between Caracal and Vieillecloche.
One might have supposed they would not be
quite so thick! I don’t understand it,” was Phil’s conclusion.
Moreover, he was accustomed never to take seriously
what Caracal said or did.
</p>

<p>
“Besides,” Phil added, “Poufaille must know what
is going on. I have not seen him come out, but he will
tell me to-night.” So he determined to dine at Mère
Michel’s, where he would have a chance of seeing Poufaille.
</p>

<p>
For a long time he had not met the <i>copains</i>—they had
almost become strangers to him. The talk about art and
the masterpieces traced with a burnt match on grimy
tables no longer interested him. He felt himself out of
place in the environment, but he wished to see Poufaille
that very evening. To begin with, he would have the
pleasure of offering his services to the poor devil, who
could not be very rich, to judge from the sale at the Hôtel
Drouot a few days before. Phil would find some delicate
means of being useful to him. Who knows if he would
ever see him again? It would be like a farewell to his
own past. So Phil went to Mère Michel’s.
</p>

<p>
His past mounted up to his brain. It seemed to rise
up whole and entire before him when, near the Boulevard,
in a narrow street, he saw the painted canvas and
fixtures deposited at the stage entrance of a circus. The
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_241' name='Page_241' href='#Page_241'>241</a></span>
damp courtyard, the frayed walls, the store-rooms of
stage-properties, the theater’s insides—all that was a
little of his own past.
</p>

<p>
It was himself, again, whom he elbowed in the Boulevard
beside the Café des Artistes, where women with red
tresses topped with feathers were drinking from little
glasses with ill-shaven messieurs, showing each other
photographs and programs, and signing engagements
with fingers stiff with rings. Phil could hear their technical
slang: <i>Chiqué-dèche—purée-j’te fais une bleue
en cinq secs!</i> “Garçon, two absinthes, and get a move on
you, <i>bougre d’andouille</i>!”
</p>

<p>
Strolling artists offered to do his portrait for two sous.
A bohemian imitated an <i>ocarina</i> by swelling out his
cheeks. A contortionist spread his little carpet and dislocated
himself on the sidewalk.
</p>

<p>
“Do you like my trade?” he said to Phil, who stood
looking at him. “If you do, I’ll hire you!”
</p>

<p>
“What a world it is, all the same! And to think that
once I loved it all,” Phil thought, as he turned away.
</p>

<p>
Farther on there was a restaurant still celebrated for
the reason that, long ago, my Lord l’Arsouille had supped
there with Cora Pearl. As Phil passed in front of it, he
saw the staircase decorated with green palms, and he
thought he recognized Helia going up,—it was her hat
and cloak,—and, lifting his eyes, Phil saw, at the window
above, the profile of the Duke of Morgania. Phil lowered
his head and went his way pensively, leaving behind
him the restaurant full of fragrance and lights, wherein
the beautiful butterflies of the night were coming to burn
their wings.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_242' name='Page_242' href='#Page_242'>242</a></span>
</p>

<p>
To escape from these mournful visions, Phil called up
the remembrance of Ethel. The remainder of his way
he traversed without noticing the distance. He had already
passed the Seine and gone under the vault of the
Institut, following a quiet old street. A moment later
he was at Mère Michel’s. A volley of enthusiastic cries
welcomed him. Phil asked himself if he were not the
plaything of a dream.
</p>

<p>
“Vive Phil! Hurrah for Phil! Bravo, Phil! A <i>ban</i>
for Phil!”
</p>

<p>
“<i>Pan! pan! pan! pan! pan!</i>”
</p>

<p>
“It must be my tall hat,” thought Phil, and he took
it off with a quick movement. The welcome doubled its
noise.
</p>

<p>
“Vive Phil!”
</p>

<p>
“Hurrah!”
</p>

<p>
“Am I dreaming?” Phil asked himself, “or are these
men crazy?” They were all crowding round him, patting
him on the back and shaking his hand.
</p>

<p>
“Old Phil!”
</p>

<p>
“Good old Phil!”
</p>

<p>
“My best compliments, old comrade!”
</p>

<p>
“Compliments for what? Whose compliments?” Phil
asked in a daze.
</p>

<p>
“But for your picture, of course!”
</p>

<p>
“What picture?”
</p>

<p>
“Your picture in the Luxembourg. Haven’t you read
the papers?”
</p>

<p>
You could have “knocked Phil over with a feather.”
They were telling him he had a picture in the Luxembourg,
and he was the only one not to know it! Surely
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_243' name='Page_243' href='#Page_243'>243</a></span>
they must be amusing themselves with him—they must
have got up a practical joke. So he went away, ill disposed
for a <i>rigolade</i> after the events of the day.
</p>

<p>
He had not gone ten steps when he stumbled on Poufaille;
but it was Poufaille cold and sinister, a Northern
Poufaille as it were, closer buttoned up than Vieillecloche
in his rôle as statesman.
</p>

<p>
“How goes it?” Phil said cordially, holding out his
hand.
</p>

<p>
Poufaille did not budge.
</p>

<p>
“What’s the matter?” said Phil. “You’re giving
me the cold shoulder! Is everybody losing his head?
You won’t take my hand, good old Poufaille!”
</p>

<p>
“I am no longer your good old Poufaille!”
</p>

<p>
“But what have I done?” Phil asked.
</p>

<p>
“What have you done?” Poufaille burst out, unable
to restrain himself longer. “I’ll tell you what you’ve
done. You’ve stolen my share of glory—you sign pictures
which were painted by me! I’ve seen my cows
in the Luxembourg, signed by your name—the picture
into which I put my whole soul!”
</p>

<p>
If lightning had fallen at Phil’s feet he would have
been less surprised. So he was the robber cuckoo and
Poufaille was the young genius! Now he understood the
meaning of the “Punch d’Indignation.”
</p>

<p>
“That’s what you’ve done to me!” Poufaille cried,
quite beside himself. “You would hinder me from flying
with my own wings. I had something here” (and Poufaille
gave himself a tremendous blow on the forehead),
“I had something here—and you robbed me of it!”
</p>

<p>
“Your cows—” Phil began in distress, “it was a joke
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_244' name='Page_244' href='#Page_244'>244</a></span>
I wanted to play on Caracal. I bought the picture and
signed it—that is true. But was it yours? I didn’t
know it.”
</p>

<p>
“You didn’t know it! Doesn’t one know the mark
of the lion?”
</p>

<p>
“My good Poufaille, let me explain it to you—let
me—” Phil all but stammered; (it was not easy to tell
Poufaille that his picture had been used as a scarecrow)—“let
me explain it to you.”
</p>

<p>
“We’ll have the explanation in public,” Poufaille
shouted.
</p>

<p>
“Only let me tell you, my dear Poufaille—”
</p>

<p>
But Poufaille would listen to nothing. He only knew
that he was perishing of hunger while another was stealing
his glory. In his rage fragments of the speech came
back to him in chance words: “<i>Les autochtones!</i>—young
genius—you have deposited in the bosom of glory an
<i>autochtone’s</i> egg—do you understand?—an <i>autochtone’s</i>
egg!”
</p>

<p>
“Poufaille,” Phil said gravely, “if I have done you
wrong, I swear it was not done wilfully. How much do
you think your cows are worth? I’ll give you whatever
you ask.”
</p>

<p>
“Money!” Poufaille answered indignantly. “You
dare offer me money to purchase my silence!”
</p>

<p>
“Listen to me, I beseech you!”
</p>

<p>
“No! I am going to tell them all about it inside
there!” and Poufaille, terrible and furious, entered
Mère Michel’s.
</p>

<p>
It was now Phil’s turn to be angry—not against the
poor simpleton Poufaille, but Caracal should pay for
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_245' name='Page_245' href='#Page_245'>245</a></span>
this! “What will Miss Rowrer think of me with this
story of a forged signature?” Phil said to himself.
</p>

<p>
The idea that his name figured on a picture in the
collection of daubs which form the foreign hall of the
Luxembourg Museum—and that just when he dreamed
he was sure of fame! At the very thought he clenched
his fists with fury. So Caracal had bewitched the Fine
Arts Commission into accepting such a horror!—or perhaps
they were willing to discredit American art by
presenting to the public a wretched work bought for a
few sous in a junk-shop! And now he, Phil, was to
suffer shipwreck from the ridiculousness of it, while
Ethel would laugh! What could be Caracal’s aim?
With a flash it came to him that the abominable critic
wished to make him grotesque and odious at the same
time.
</p>

<p>
“Ah, Caracal,” Phil said to himself, “you are mistaken
this time. You shall pay for all this!”
</p>

<p>
A sudden idea came to him: “What if I should go
and punch his head!”
</p>

<p>
He knew he should find Caracal at home at that hour.
It was the day before the feuilleton, impertinent and
familiar, which he was in the habit of signing “A Parisian,”
or the <i>chronique scandaleuse</i> of courts by an
“Old Diplomat,” alternating with art criticisms signed
“Caracal.” A cab happened to be passing. Phil hailed
it, called out the address to the driver, and—<i>en route</i>!
What streets he took, through what quarters, Phil did
not know. He knew only that the critic was going to
have a bad quarter of an hour. He must have from
him a frank explanation, without dodging or subterfuge.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_246' name='Page_246' href='#Page_246'>246</a></span>
This time there would be no duel carried on by
winking the eye and shrugging the shoulder. Phil stiffened
his arm as the cab stopped short. He jumped
to the ground and with three steps reached the concierge’s
lodge.
</p>

<p>
“M. Caracal, if you please?”
</p>

<p>
“Seventh floor, last door—on the court!”
</p>

<p>
Phil ran quickly up the stairs. A thick carpet deadened
his steps, and he could hear, behind the doors, the
sound of pianos or the laughter of children. He imagined
to himself the pleasant homes with their lamps
surrounded by a circle of golden heads.
</p>

<p>
“Good, simple, good people!” Phil thought. “Perhaps
it is from you that Caracal takes his studies for ‘The
House of Glass’—wolf in the sheepfold that he is!”
</p>

<p>
The thought increased his anger. He went up and up.
At last he was going to see that apartment of Caracal’s
which no one ever entered. No doubt it would be insolent
in its luxury and have a big valet in the anteroom
and invaluable pictures which this grafter of the
press must have extorted for his collection of art works,
of which he was always talking in his articles.
</p>

<p>
Seventh floor, last door! It must be there. Phil had
reached it. There was no bell! Phil knocked, but there
was no reply. The key had been forgotten in the door,
and he entered. On a table a small lamp shed its light
over papers and books. There were other books on the
ground and on chairs—perhaps the encyclopedia from
which Caracal drew his weekly erudition. In the half-obscurity,
farther back, Phil saw a brass bedstead like
a child’s couch. Beside it, on a chest of drawers, there
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_247' name='Page_247' href='#Page_247'>247</a></span>
were garments carefully folded and a hat protected
from the dust by a newspaper. On the floor were shoes
beside a blacking-brush. On the chimneypiece there
was a photograph in which an old lady held the hand
of an old gentleman. Everything in the room was neatly
ordered and touching in its simplicity.
</p>

<p>
“I must have mistaken the floor,” Phil said to himself.
“This is not the apartment of an arbiter of society
elegance.”
</p>

<p>
He was on the point of retreating when, on a sofa near
him in the shadow, some one moved, and he seemed to
hear a sob. Phil started back and the figure on the sofa
came into full light. It was Caracal asleep. There was
an expression of sadness on his face and tears were on
his cheeks—the cheeks which Phil had always seen
smirking with a convulsive sneer.
</p>

<p>
Caracal, when he came home, must have thrown himself
on the sofa worn out with his day’s work. The calm
which had come over his features showed that he had
dropped off to sleep in some sad and gentle dream. Phil,
in spite of himself, looked up to the chimneypiece where
the old lady and the old gentleman seemed watching over
their child—yes, yes, Phil was sure of it now, from the
sadness on the face of Caracal. He must have gone back
to his childhood; perhaps, in his dreams, he heard the
beloved voices which had long since become silent. A
sob from Caracal made Phil tremble again—a dull, deep
sob like the sigh of a dying man. One would have said
that his whole life was rising up before him—his heart’s
bitterness, humiliations undergone and illusions fled, the
success of others and regrets for his own ill-doing.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_248' name='Page_248' href='#Page_248'>248</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Phil felt his anger fade away. He divined all the
wretchedness of his life, so full of meanness and bluff.
Asleep, the poor creature, overcome by his distress,
seemed sacred to him. He went out without noise.
</p>

<p>
“Old Caracal,” he murmured, “I’ll leave you to your
dream—that shall be your punishment.”

<h3>
CHAPTER VIII
<br />
A QUEEN FOR KINGS
</h3>

<p>
Poufaille, seated on a high stool, was copying
in the Louvre Gallery. Since his share of glory
had been stolen from him, he had become as downcast
as a caged lion from whom his quarter of meat has
been taken. Poor Poufaille! Everything fell to pieces
in his hands. His studio had been dispersed at auction;
“Liberty” and “Fraternity” had been sold for nothing,
not even for enough to pay up the garlic- and potato-seller.
And his cows were in the Luxembourg under
another name! What reasons for sadness! He did not
even listen to Suzanne, babbling near him on a lower
seat. He was timidly copying the goat and kids of Paul
Potter. The company of such good animals consoled
him a little for that of men.
</p>

<p>
He was a touching sight, with the veins in his forehead
swollen by his effort, exhausting himself in the
handling of brushes and paint-knives, which were things
too delicate for his big hairy hands made for the plow
and the wine-press.
</p>

<p>
Nothing could amuse him. Yet Suzanne lifted toward
him her laughing face and told her funniest stories. One
was an adventure of the other evening, when she had
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_250' name='Page_250' href='#Page_250'>250</a></span>
taken Helia’s hat and cloak to go and sup with the
duke. <i>Mon Dieu!</i> how she had laughed. At the thought
of it she still held her sides, careless of the stares of the
public.
</p>

<p>
“I wish you had been there, my little Poufaille, when
I went up the stairs. They bowed to me as if I were a
queen—<i>ah, mais oui!</i> I made myself as fine as I could
and I had Helia’s hat and cloak. If Phil had seen me
he might have thought it was Helia.
</p>

<p>
“<i>Eh bien! quoi!</i>” Suzanne exclaimed, interrupting
herself to look at Poufaille. “What do you mean by
grinding your teeth when I speak of Phil? One would
say you were going to eat some one up. Phil doesn’t
hear us, you know; he is up there with Helia, who is
posing for him in what they used to call their oasis—the
garden, you know, where you wanted to grow potatoes.
Oh, forgive me, my little Poufaille, I didn’t wish to hurt
your feelings,” Suzanne added quickly, as she saw Poufaille
clenching his fist at the remembrance of the rejected
potatoes, as painful to him as the stolen share of
glory. Poufaille went back to work with a heavy sigh.
</p>

<p>
“Besides,” Suzanne went on, “you know I’m not so
stuck on Phil myself any more, and I wish he were here,
to tell him what I think of his way of acting toward
Helia. I wouldn’t hide the truth from him; and I’d like
to know if he’d answer as he used to do in his attic—‘I’m
not that kind of a man!’ Ah!” Suzanne continued,
“you’re all the same, you men! You’re not worth the
rope to hang you!”
</p>

<p>
Poufaille sighed as if his heart were breaking. He
kept on painting his goat and kids.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_251' name='Page_251' href='#Page_251'>251</a></span>
</p>

<p>
“I wish you had been there when the garçon brought
me in,” Suzanne began again, to finish her story. “Imagine
a table all spread with fruits and flowers and
lights; and whom do I see coming toward me but the
duke, in evening clothes, leaning over and kissing my
hand. I had my veil down and he did not recognize
me—it was Helia he was waiting for; the duke had invited
her with a little note, very well expressed, you
know, such as dukes know how to write. When Helia
had opened the note she asked me to go and present her
excuses. You can imagine I took the opportunity—I
whom you see before you. I had supped before that
with smart people, but with a duke never! What would
you have done, Poufaille? That humbug of a Caracal
once told me I should have to get down on my knees
when I spoke to him. Well, I just took off my veil and
said: ‘Cuckoo! It’s me! You’re waiting for Helia,
but she begs to be excused!’ Would you think men
could be so odd? My little Poufaille, Helia’s stock went
up with him at once. I could see it by the way he spoke
of her. But never mind that; he was very amiable and
kept me to dinner. I didn’t wish to, but he insisted so—and
it’s a very chic place, that restaurant. Then all
at once there was a squabble at the door and I saw two
bears coming in!—I mean two men like bears, bowing to
the ground to the duke and calling him monseigneur.
They spoke of lots of things—that they had just come
from the monseigneur’s house; that they had been told
monseigneur was in diplomatic consultation—<i>et patati et
patata</i>—and then there was Turkey and Morgania and
I don’t know what all. The duke had a very embarrassed
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_252' name='Page_252' href='#Page_252'>252</a></span>
look—‘my dear Zrnitschka—Bjelopawlitji—my
dear minister—’
</p>

<p>
“Ministers—those two bears! I was bursting! And,
on my word, I believe the duke presented me as the diplomatic
agent! After that there was dinner and jokes and
songs, and the duke brewed a champagne salad, while I
tickled the two bears under the chin to make them swallow
brandied cherries.”
</p>

<p>
Suzanne spoke in vain. Poufaille kept the fated look
of a man who has been grazed by glory as it passes. He
lifted his head sullenly and then let it fall again on his
breast, as if crushed.
</p>

<p>
“Attention!” suddenly cried Suzanne, who was looking
down the gallery. “Here are serious customers—Miss
Rowrer and Mme. Rowrer, Mr. Will, the duke,
and Caracal. I’m sure they’re going to visit Phil up
there in his oasis. Helia isn’t expecting such an
honor!”
</p>

<p>
Miss Rowrer and her party came on, a compact group
among the scattered visitors. Ethel was listening absently
to Caracal. Grandma was examining the crowd.
The duke was winking at the pictures, while Will looked
at the parquet floor.
</p>

<p>
Caracal seemed delighted. Besides his opportunity
to shine by telling off names and dates, he was also going
to show the party one of the hanging gardens of Paris.
Presently he would explain the very <i>modus operandi</i>
for making such blooming terraces—fine sand, tar,
gravel, and earth.
</p>

<p>
“You know, Miss Rowrer, you go to the Louvre Gardens
up a staircase.”
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_253' name='Page_253' href='#Page_253'>253</a></span>

<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_255' name='Page_255' href='#Page_255'>255</a></span>
</p>

<p>
“Awful!” said grandma.
</p>

<p>
“A winding staircase cut in the thickness of the wall.”
</p>

<p>
“Really! Oh, how nice that is!” said Ethel, to whom
these little details gave the sensation of being abroad.
She forgave the lack of an elevator, as long as the staircase
was winding and cut in the thickness of the wall—something
impossible to find in her own country.
</p>

<p>
“It’s a kind of Jacob’s ladder that will take us up to
Paradise,” Caracal continued. “A real Paradise, where
I myself have known an Adam and Eve, known them
personally, intimately!”
</p>

<p>
“Oh, M. Caracal, don’t talk of that now,” Miss Rowrer
said, “but tell me what this picture is.”
</p>

<p>
Caracal explained the picture, regretting that Ethel
did not question him about the Adam and Eve he had
known in the Paradise.
</p>

<p>
Poufaille, who had lifted his head, lowered it quickly.
The party was just in front of him, all looking at his
picture. He had heard Caracal say to Miss Rowrer:
“An artist, a great artist, with a brain, but no luck!
It is incredible, his lack of luck—I could tell you a
story—”
</p>

<p>
But Caracal was interrupted by grandma, who noticed
the frayed cravat and worn shoes of Poufaille, and
pointed him out to Will. Caracal presented Poufaille,
who nearly fell from his high stool. The duke bowed.
Ethel greeted him cordially, as well as Suzanne, at whom
the duke did not even look.
</p>

<p>
“That’s the way of the world!” Suzanne thought
within herself.
</p>

<p>
“Do you really wish me to buy such a daub?” Will
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_256' name='Page_256' href='#Page_256'>256</a></span>
said in an aside to grandma, after judging, at a glance,
the “Goat and the Kids.”
</p>

<p>
“Poor devil! he is in rags,” Ethel murmured.
</p>

<p>
“All right,” Will answered; “it’s frightful, but I’ll
send it to my farm in Texas—it will give them a poor
idea of grazing in the old country!”
</p>

<p>
Poufaille felt his legs tremble under him, and thought
all the torrents of Pactolus were pouring down upon him
when Will, taking his leave, gave him in advance the
money for the order.
</p>

<p>
“Au revoir, Mlle. Suzanne! M. Poufaille, au revoir!”
Miss Rowrer said, not a little flattered to know, not a
Charley, but a real and genuine bohemian.
</p>

<p>
With a final bow, Poufaille watched the party going
away, in utter amazement at the possession of so much
money.
</p>

<p>
“Vive la joie—and fried potatoes!” Suzanne said, by
way of moral.
</p>

<p>
Soon Ethel and grandma, Will, the duke, and Caracal
were lost in the distance.
</p>

<p>
“You would think Caracal was the chief of the party,”
Suzanne remarked to Poufaille; “only look—you see
nothing but him!”
</p>

<p>
Indeed, Caracal, who at first was abashed at not being
allowed to tell the story of Adam and Eve, nor that of
the false signature of the Luxembourg, became doubly
amiable, and fished for compliments because of his courageous
behavior toward Vieillecloche, a man with five
corpses in his trail. Meanwhile, he went on explaining,
endlessly, the pictures of the old masters. He greeted
them as friends; he spoke familiarly of the painters,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_257' name='Page_257' href='#Page_257'>257</a></span>
called them by their first names and their nicknames—the
old Breughel—the young Teniers—“Van Ryn” for
Rembrandt—and so on.
</p>

<p>
He told over the jokes about the Louvre Museum. It
was a national lounge, heated in winter and the place for
a siesta in summer. He attacked the curators, who were
incompetent, to his thinking; and he cited the forged
art objects bought for their weight in gold, crowns and
coins and jewels, and the famous Holbein on a mahogany
panel—the Louvre’s pride up to the day when, scratching
it on the back, the words appeared: “Flor de Habaña—Lawyers’
Club Brand”!
</p>

<p>
The duke passed along heedlessly. The Louvre for him
was, most of all, a place in which you can talk amid
sumptuous decoration. His only real interest in painting
was in the hall of the Italian primitives, before the
St. Morgana of Botticelli.
</p>

<p>
“St. Morgana, my ancestress,” he said to Miss
Rowrer.
</p>

<p>
He drew himself up as he pointed to the saint, amid
the choir of angels, in a sky of gold above a fantastic
landscape, where architecture and monuments were piled
together. He seemed moved, especially when he explained
to Miss Rowrer that he should definitively be
obliged to go back to Morgania, that grave events were
on the way, and that only the other evening he had had
a diplomatic interview with his people’s delegates.
</p>

<p>
Miss Rowrer liked him better, with this air of one convinced
of his own importance and duties, than when he
was making fun of himself with the skeptical tone which
she abhorred. Just as she was glad to know a real and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_258' name='Page_258' href='#Page_258'>258</a></span>
genuine bohemian, so she was delighted to walk with the
scion of a legendary family, whose ancestress figured in
the Louvre, painted by Botticelli, surrounded by angels
in a golden sky. She found it amusing to take the arm
of a man in whose pedigree there was the equal of the
White Lady of Potsdam and the Cavalier of Hatfield
House. It was all so un-American and exciting.
</p>

<p>
She was also really at her ease in the Louvre among
these old royal personages. She pleased herself in the
midst of history and polished courts. Her intelligence
revealed to her their grandeur.
</p>

<p>
“I like sincere men who are faithful to their traditions,”
she said. “There is a noble side to it all which
I understand.”
</p>

<p>
She admired the effete generations who had heaped
here, to the very ceiling, royal escutcheons and chimeras
and victories.
</p>

<p>
“There is something great in it,” she said; “you feel
the conviction of it. Compare it with the frightful style
which artists bungle with nowadays! The beautiful
has had its time here; it is our turn now, in our great
Republic! Faith in traditions—that is what produces
masterpieces! Whether royalty, as in the old times, or
the Republic, as with us—I recognize only that.”
</p>

<p>
“But there is a golden mean,” the duke said, conciliatingly.
</p>

<p>
“Away with the golden mean, with cowardly compromises
and satisfied selfishness, with falsehood and insincerity.
We must be one thing or another—loyalty before
all else!”
</p>

<p>
Grandma and Will approved this.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_259' name='Page_259' href='#Page_259'>259</a></span>
</p>

<p>
“Ah!” the duke thought to himself, struck by Miss
Rowrer’s accents of conviction, “it wouldn’t be well to
fail in one’s words to this lady!”
</p>

<p>
“This is a Signorelli,” Caracal explained, pointing
out a picture; “this is a Filippo Lippi; this is a Pinturicchio.”
</p>

<p>
“Say, M. Caracal, if we stop at every picture of the
Quattro Cento we shall never reach Paradise. Where
is your winding staircase?”
</p>

<p>
There were halls after halls, marbles and gilding, the
Salon Carré, and galleries with resplendent jewels; marble
for the pavement, and then parquetry shining like a
smooth lake, and pictures, and pictures again. The copyists
were up on their ladders in galleries, which heap together
civilizations that have disappeared, statues of gods
and the mummies of kings, decayed grandeur pell-mell
with fragments of columns and open tombs and women’s
jewels. And there was the crouching sphinx seeming to
take them to witness that all things pass like a dream.
</p>

<p>
Miss Rowrer and the duke walked together. In front
were grandma and Will and Caracal. The duke sought
to understand Miss Rowrer’s ideas, which seemed contradictory
to him. How was he to reconcile her admiration
both for republic and royalty?
</p>

<p>
“Miss Rowrer,” the duke began, “your theories are
contrary to progress. Your extreme loyalty implies a
government which is unchangeable.”
</p>

<p>
“Not at all!” Ethel answered. “Greatness is in
the constant effort toward progress; it is the pursuit
of the best. A people’s loyalty toward its king is very
beautiful.”
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_260' name='Page_260' href='#Page_260'>260</a></span>
</p>

<p>
“<i>Eh bien</i>, then!” the duke replied.
</p>

<p>
“I told you my way of looking at things the day we
visited St. Denis,” Ethel continued. “But you forget one
thing—the king’s loyalty to his people!”
</p>

<p>
They were leaving the gallery and walking ever onward.
They saw a monumental staircase under a vault
as high as a cathedral apse, and then there were more
halls, with marbles and gilding and galleries, never
ending.
</p>

<p>
“But where is your Paradise?” Miss Rowrer asked.
</p>

<p>
“It is here,” answered Caracal.
</p>

<p>
He gave a glance at the guardian who was pacing up
and down the hall, and Will slipped a heavy <i>pourboire</i>
into the man’s hand.
</p>

<p>
“Is Monsieur Phil up there?”
</p>

<p>
“The former gardener? Yes. Go up.” Lifting a
piece of tapestry at the corner of a wall, a little door
appeared—it was the door of the staircase.
</p>

<p>
“Go ahead, M. Caracal; show us the way!” Ethel
said.
</p>

<p>
Caracal, proud to lead, showed them the way up. They
went on, turning round and round in single file, the staircase
being wide enough for nothing else.
</p>

<p>
“This reminds me of going up the Monument in
London,” Ethel said.
</p>

<p>
“And me of the corkscrew in the Mammoth Cave,”
said grandma.
</p>

<p>
“Only a few more steps,” said Caracal, as he opened
the door giving on the roof.
</p>

<p>
The light was dazzling. Great clouds floated high in a
sky that was sweet and calm. Across the branches of the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_261' name='Page_261' href='#Page_261'>261</a></span>
garden they looked on Paris, bathed in sun. The great
city stretched out from horizon to horizon and, vibrating
with the heat, seemed to wave like a sea. Grandma,
Ethel, and Will, as well as the duke, stopped short.
While the distant view was full of grandeur, the nearer
scene was just as charming. There were shaded alleys,
and under the oleanders and apple- and pear-trees, currants
and strawberries were ripening. Caracal was already
beginning his explanations.
</p>

<p>
“The green spots you see over there are the hanging
gardens of the Rue de Valois. If we were a little higher
up we could see those of the Automobile Club of the
Place de la Concorde. This is the way they make them—first
a layer of Norway tar, then fine sand, and then
gravel—”
</p>

<p>
“M. Caracal,” Ethel interrupted, “you are right; this
is a real Paradise!”
</p>

<p>
“And over there you have Adam and Eve,” Caracal
said, pointing amid the greenery to where Phil was painting
Helia, posed in an old arm-chair half hidden by
climbing plants.
</p>

<p>
“That is what is best in the Louvre,” Ethel said to
the group, looking at Helia. “Let us greet her Majesty
Beauty!”
</p>

<p>
Phil had just caught sight of Ethel and her party.
He hurriedly laid down his palette and came forward.
Helia saw them also, and arose and bowed. Ethel
recognized her and spoke with a friendly manner. They
looked at each other in that peculiar way which women
have of taking each other’s measure,—it was like a mute
dialogue between Beauty and Culture. But Beauty—poor
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_262' name='Page_262' href='#Page_262'>262</a></span>
Helia—lowered her eyes. She became humble and
acknowledged herself vanquished.
</p>

<p>
For Helia no longer had any hope. She understood,
she saw with fright the ever-growing distance between
herself and Phil. Ah, no! Phil was no longer the same;
he was above her, far above, among the rich and powerful;
and he would continue his upward march, while she,
Helia, would, little by little, go downwards.
</p>

<p>
She had agreed to pose for him that day—it was the
decisive test. It had cost her much to do it. Phil, after
all, ought to know what his conscience told him to do;
but she did not wish there should be any fault on
her part. She had never had the courage to say to herself
it was all over, until this day, which she was passing alone
with him. She had come to see if he would remember—if
the trees in bloom amid their oasis would recall anything
to him. She counted on the complicity of the blue sky
and the fragrance of roses. But the day had passed,
under the splendid heavens, and they had not, as in
other days, gathered fruit from the trees or picked flowers
from the parterres. Phil had been good-natured, but
he was like a friend and nothing more. Phil—she saw it
clearly—Phil would be a stranger for her to-morrow.
Who knows? The time might come when he would forget
even her name.
</p>

<p>
Helia acknowledged that it was possible when she
looked at Miss Rowrer, who drew near and began chatting
with Phil. What charm there was in her words!
Helia was never tired of listening to her. She felt no
jealousy of Ethel, whose goodness saved her from envy.
She admired her in silence. Sometimes, like a lightning
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_263' name='Page_263' href='#Page_263'>263</a></span>
flash, she seemed to understand the abyss which separated
them, and then everything reëntered the shadow.
No—she did not know; everything escaped her grasp
in that sphere of life, more inaccessible to her than
the white clouds up in the depths of the azure. What
had she with which to struggle against this young girl,
so brilliant and so playful, before whom Phil and the
duke were content to seem little? And then, she was so
rich!
</p>

<p>
But Helia blushed for herself and quickly cast away
any thoughts of Miss Rowrer’s wealth. Since she could
not help loving Phil, she at least would not cease giving
him her esteem. She looked in a sort of fear at Miss
Rowrer, of whom so much was said, and who seemed so
simple and gay. What could she do against so many
advantages—she, Helia, who had only her beauty? And
perhaps Phil found her ugly now!
</p>

<p>
“What are you painting?” Ethel asked Phil. “I
suppose I may look.”
</p>

<p>
“Miss Rowrer, I beg you,” Phil answered, “give me
your advice.”
</p>

<p>
Miss Rowrer squinted with her eye, measured and
made a few professional gestures, probably the only
thing she retained from her art studies among so many
social duties. She remarked a few things, showing refined
tastes, and then looked at Helia as a connoisseur.
</p>

<p>
She admired her noble profile, like that of a marble
Venus, her full neck and bare arms, and the sumptuous
thickness of her hair over shoulders which would have
thrown Phidias into despair.
</p>

<p>
“What success a young girl like that would have in
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_264' name='Page_264' href='#Page_264'>264</a></span>
society—if she belonged to society—” thought Miss Rowrer.
“Ought not beauty like that to overcome all social
distinctions?”
</p>

<p>
Helia appeared to Miss Rowrer as the splendid flowering
of the Louvre, personifying in herself all the masterpieces
heaped up beneath their feet—all that men have
loved and made divine in marble or on canvas. At her
feet roses and fuchsias breathed forth their fragrance,
sweet as the Attic breeze.
</p>

<p>
“What you are doing there, Monsieur Phil, is very fine—a
magnificent study,” Miss Rowrer said. “But it is
not up to the model. Is it, Monsieur le Duc?”
</p>

<p>
The duke assented.
</p>

<p>
“Tell me, Monsieur Phil,” Miss Rowrer continued,
“what is that thing on the ground, with your palette on
top of it?”
</p>

<p>
She pointed to one of the busts which lined the walks.
</p>

<p>
“Those are busts,” Phil began.
</p>

<p>
“Yes, but of whom?” Ethel asked.
</p>

<p>
“Imperial and presidential busts,” Phil explained,
“Napoleon III, Charles X, Louis Philippe.”
</p>

<p>
“Really,” Miss Rowrer said, with amusement; “only
think, each bust represents a revolution. They are sovereigns
who no longer pleased—let them be an example
to you, monseigneur,” she added, laughing. “This is
not Paradise, then, but the other place—each of these
busts is a paving-stone of good intentions!”
</p>

<p>
“And that, Phil, that old arm-chair which has lost its
gilding? Mademoiselle Helia, who was in it just now,
looked, with these busts at her feet, like a sovereign surrounded
by the dwarfs of the court. What is that old
arm-chair?”

</p>

<p>
“A throne, Miss Rowrer!”
</p>

<p>
“Now you are laughing at me!”
</p>

<p>
“Not at all.”
</p>

<p>
“The throne of some fairy king?”
</p>

<p>
“The throne of King Louis Philippe,” answered Phil.
In a few words he explained how it happened to be there
in the company of the busts.
</p>

<p>
“It is not a very comfortable seat,” grandma remarked.
</p>

<p>
“They’d make a better one than that at Grand Rapids,”
Will added.
</p>

<p>
“Will you try it, Miss Rowrer?” Caracal hastened to
ask. “Be seated on the throne; you might believe yourself
a queen.”
</p>

<p>
“Ah! that’s all the same to me,” said Miss Rowrer.
</p>

<p>
“The queen you are worthy to be,” Caracal corrected,
by way of compliment. “You would not have ill become
Louis Philippe’s throne, I imagine.”
</p>

<p>
“I hope not, indeed,” Ethel replied. “What! that
bourgeois king, that king of the golden mean, who was
neither brave nor cowardly, without vice as without
virtue, flat, like a pancake; an old wolf turned shepherd?
And I could sit on a throne and fancy myself the consort
of that imitation goodman, be queen of such a king?
Even for his kingdom, I would not!”
</p>

<p>
Helia looked at Miss Rowrer as she prodded with her
parasol the worn velvet of the throne. She thought of
her own half hesitation to sit down in it the first time
she came to the oasis, and how she had answered Phil:
“A king’s throne! You wouldn’t think of it—a poor
girl like me!” To her it had seemed a sort of sacrilege,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_268' name='Page_268' href='#Page_268'>268</a></span>
whereas Miss Rowrer, quite the contrary, turned her
back on it with disdain and walked away, saying to the
duke and Phil:
</p>

<p>
“Louis Philippe was possibly a king, but at any rate
he was not a man! The people did well to cast him out.”
</p>

<p>
And Helia asked herself in amazement: “Who is this
Miss Rowrer that judges kings and would refuse them
their kingdoms? Is she, then, more than a queen?”

<h3>
CHAPTER I
<br />
TEUFF-TEUFF! TEUFF! BRRR!
</h3>

<p>
We should need words from the old, old time,
worn from long use, to give an idea of Mme.
de Grojean’s house in her little corner of the
provinces. It was typical of its kind and just the opposite
of any truly Parisian corner. The latter would
have been a populous, noisy street, with odors from the
markets, from horses, from tobacco. The former was a
deserted street, where you could hear sparrows chattering
on the housetops and breathe the fragrance of mignonette
and new-mown hay.
</p>

<p>
The house of Mme. de Grojean—“grand’mère,” as
Yvonne called her—formed the angle of a street on a
very provincial place. It was on an open space, in the
middle of which a water-jet, long since dry, marked on
its basin a turning shadow like a sun-dial.
</p>

<p>
The house and garden wall formed one of the sides
of the place as far as the river, which was crossed by a
bridge; and, beyond, the plain stretched out.
</p>

<p>
Place and house, and trees overhanging the wall, and
the street where grass grew between the paving-stones—all
had the look of having always been there, of being
there forever,—changeless as the hills of the horizon.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_272' name='Page_272' href='#Page_272'>272</a></span>
But worthiest of description was the salon where
grand’mère with her daughter and her granddaughter
Yvonne were seated in the dim light, amid tapestries of
old silk and brown furniture, with glints of brass and
portraits in their frames.
</p>

<p>
Grand’mère sat squarely back in her wheeled chair,
knitting a pair of stockings. The younger Mme. de Grojean
was looking through a fashion-paper. Yvonne, by
the half-opened blinds, glanced from time to time out on
the place while continuing her work. Her little table
was encumbered with ribbons and light stuffs. She was
finishing a gown, with a heap of patterns around her;
and her little scissors traveled slowly through the muslin.
</p>

<p>
“It’s this ribbon that gives me trouble,” Yvonne said,
half aloud, as if speaking to herself. “Why, this ribbon
should go on the right!” she went on, with a comical air
of surprise.
</p>

<p>
“By no means, my daughter!” Mme. de Grojean protested.
</p>

<p>
“Yes, yes! I assure you. Look at the fashion-paper.
I must find out for myself,” Yvonne concluded gravely,
with her chin in her hand and her eyes fixed on the engraving.
“I shall have to ask Cousin Henri, who was
present at the last ball of the prefecture.”
</p>

<p>
“Yvonne,” said the grandmother, stopping her knitting,
“Yvonne, really, you have nothing but dresses in
your head. Rather than lose your time on such trifles,
you’d do better to finish picking the lint for the soldiers.”
</p>

<p>
“Grand’mère, here’s the circus coming!” Yvonne interrupted
suddenly, as she looked out on the place.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_273' name='Page_273' href='#Page_273'>273</a></span>

<p class="caption">Watching the Arrival of the Rowrers</p>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_274' name='Page_274' href='#Page_274'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_275' name='Page_275' href='#Page_275'>275</a></span>
</p>

<p>
“Those mountebanks?” grand’mère said, looking in
her turn. “They are coming to the fair, just as they do
every year. It must be they—I can tell by the dust they
make. Only the big drum is lacking to make it complete.”
</p>

<p>
In fact, an odd-looking vehicle had drawn up in the
place. It was an immense auto, like a top-carriage behind
and torpedo-like in front. In the carriage part two
ladies were seated; two men occupied the torpedo-end.
They wore big smoked glasses, which made them look like
frogs, while the enormous auto, spitting and snorting,
shook up its passengers, and rattled the canes and umbrellas
in the wicker basket behind.
</p>

<p>
“It is near four o’clock,” grand’mère said, consulting
the familiar shadow of the water-jet. “They must be
crazy to be exposing themselves to the heat; but such
people fear nothing.”
</p>

<p>
“They’re brought up to rough it,” Yvonne remarked.
</p>

<p>
“But people are saluting them, on my word,” grand’mère
said. “There is the <i>adjoint</i>, who must be there for
the license; and there’s Mme. Riçois also, and others
besides. It looks as if they were personal acquaintances;
they are shaking hands!”
</p>

<p>
Grand’mère in astonishment saw the ladies in the carriage-end
part holding out their hands like princesses.
One of them, the younger, got down and moved about to
stir herself. As far as could be seen at that distance,
between dust and sun, she was dressed in a light silk,
very becoming in color. The plaits of the skirt molded
her form, and fell to a level with the ground. Her head,
enveloped in a cloud of gauze, was not to be seen.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_276' name='Page_276' href='#Page_276'>276</a></span>
</p>

<p>
“Where will elegance end, my poor Yvonne?” said
grand’mère. “There’s a gown worth five times as much
as your ball-dress.”
</p>

<p>
“Oh, here are the horses!” Yvonne cried, pointing to
magnificent animals which grooms were leading by the
bridle from the direction of the railway station. As they
passed by the auto the young girl went up to one of them,
patted him on the neck, and, putting her hand in her
pocket, gave him a lump of sugar.
</p>

<p>
“She must be the circus-rider,” Yvonne guessed.
</p>

<p>
On the place there was now a little group of curious
onlookers drawing near. The proprietor of the Lion
d’Or made himself important. They could imagine him
at that distance saying: “The Lion d’Or is the tourists’
rendezvous—every one puts up at my place—every one.
I do this—I have that—”
</p>

<p>
He had not the time to finish before the young girl
had quickly climbed back into the auto, given orders
to the groom, pointed to the inn, and made a sign of
farewell to everybody.
</p>

<p>
Teuff-teuff! teuff! The auto swung into movement—teuff-teuff!
brrrr! and off it went at high speed.
</p>

<p>
“Bon voyage!” grand’mère wished them. “How can
people be allowed to race about like that! and all these
do-nothings who salute them,—they couldn’t be more
polite to ambassadors!”
</p>

<p>
No doubt it was an event. Every one along the road
stared at the disappearing column of dust.
</p>

<p>
“It’s a strange world,” said grand’mère. “But here
comes Mme. Riçois; she may tell us something about
them.”

</p>

<p>
Grand’mère had scarcely finished when the bonne
opened the salon door and announced Mme. Riçois, the
banker’s wife, a little woman all fire and motion, alert
and dimpled and forever laughing.
</p>

<p>
“My compliments, dear Mme. Riçois. You have fine
acquaintances!” grand’mère began. “You can tell us, I
suppose, what has been turning our place upside down.”
</p>

<p>
“But you ought to know,” Mme. Riçois answered;
“Yvonne is better acquainted with them than I am.”
</p>

<p>
“Yvonne is acquainted with them?” grand’mère
asked severely. “Who are they?”
</p>

<p>
“The Rowrers.”
</p>

<p>
“Goodness gracious!” cried grand’mère, “in all this
dust—and in such heat?”
</p>

<p>
“The Rowrers—what luck!” Yvonne cried. “I shall
see Miss Ethel again; and I did not recognize her! All
those dusters and masks and veils—they didn’t wear
anything like that in Paris the day I went in their auto,
with Mr. Will Rowrer to conduct us.”
</p>

<p>
“Are they going to stay in our town?” Mme. de Grojean
asked.
</p>

<p>
“For several weeks, it seems.”
</p>

<p>
“Where are they stopping?” grand’mère asked. “At
the Hôtel de France or at the Hôtel d’Eurôpe?”
</p>

<p>
“They are not at a hotel,” answered Mme. Riçois, with
an important air, as one having a great piece of news to
communicate.
</p>

<p>
“Where are they going, then?” grand’mère persisted.
</p>

<p>
“To nobody’s house.”
</p>

<p>
“But where are they going to sleep? Not in the fields,
I suppose?”
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_280' name='Page_280' href='#Page_280'>280</a></span>
</p>

<p>
“Exactly-in the fields,” Mme. Riçois said, looking in
turn at grand’mère, Mme. de Grojean, and Yvonne, to
enjoy their astonishment.
</p>

<p>
“You mean a house in the country?” grand’mère
said. “What house?”
</p>

<p>
“No house,” Mme. Riçois answered.
</p>

<p>
“Not in the open air, I suppose?”
</p>

<p>
“Exactly; in the open air!”
</p>

<p>
The effect which Mme. Riçois had missed with “the
fields” was produced by her “open air.”
</p>

<p>
“Is it possible!” grand’mère said, as she let her knitting
fall. “People as rich as that sleep out of doors?”
</p>

<p>
“Rich!” observed Mme. Riçois. “They could buy the
town and turn it into wheat-fields!”
</p>

<p>
“Then they must be crazy!”
</p>

<p>
“For that matter,” Mme. Riçois went on, “when I say
that they sleep out of doors—”
</p>

<p>
“Do tell us—you’re laughing at us!”
</p>

<p>
“No, no! Let me explain. They are going to sleep
out of doors, but under tents—camping out, they call it
in America. I know all about it. My husband has been
in correspondence with the Rowrers and has had all the
arrangements to make. The Comtesse de Donjeon asked
them to come to her château for the summer. Miss Rowrer
simply begged the comtesse to put at her disposal a
corner of her estate, the most deserted and the most
picturesque. She has taken the part she wished and set
up her camp in it. She wanted to have it a surprise,
and that is why I kept it a secret. It seems that camping
out is delightful and Miss Rowrer intends starting the
fashion of it in France.”
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_281' name='Page_281' href='#Page_281'>281</a></span>
</p>

<p>
“Poor France!” grand’mère exclaimed. “We needed
only that! It’s just like the automobiles. I’d rather be
dragged about all my life in a cripple’s go-cart than get
into one.”
</p>

<p>
“Not I!” said Yvonne. “I should love going in an
auto!”
</p>

<p>
“Yvonne!” expostulated grand’mère.
</p>

<p>
Yvonne was silent, but thought, all the same, how delightful
it would be to go here and there in the country
and live under one’s tent, by the bank of the river, along
with Ethel. She listened absently to the remainder of
the conversation, and looked far away at the highroad,
golden with dust and with the green grass beside it.
</p>

<p>
Grand’mère took up the discourse.
</p>

<p>
“What is camping out, anyway?”
</p>

<p>
“Oh, it’s all very simple,” Mme. Riçois answered. “I
have heard my husband talking about it.”
</p>

<p>
“And I have heard Miss Ethel,” said Yvonne. “She
describes it so well!”
</p>

<p>
“But explain it to me,” grand’mère said.
</p>

<p>
They gave her an explanation, in all its details, of
camping out and summer touring and fishing, of chaperons
and boys and girls.
</p>

<p>
“What!” grand’mère cried, “young men and young
girls go camping out like that in the woods for weeks
together, simply accompanied by a chaperon, and you
consider that proper?”
</p>

<p>
“<i>Ma foi</i>, yes,” said Mme. Riçois. “I should have been
delighted with anything of the kind.”
</p>

<p>
Yvonne kept silence, but she asked herself what harm
there could be in walking through the country with
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_282' name='Page_282' href='#Page_282'>282</a></span>
Monsieur Will or Monsieur Phil. Miss Ethel did it—why
should not she?
</p>

<p>
“So that is what you call progress,” grand’mère observed.
“Milliardaires making their horses travel by
express train and lodging them at the hotel, while they
themselves wander along the highroads and sleep out of
doors like vagabonds—you must acknowledge it does
not sound well!”
</p>

<p>
“Perhaps you like that kind of thing better,” Mme.
Riçois retorted, pointing to the place.
</p>

<p>
An omnibus was driving up from the station, loaded
with trunks and packages, with its horses prancing heavily.
A traveler, with a single glass in his eye, was looking
out.
</p>

<p>
The emotion aroused by the auto had scarcely calmed
down. People were standing in the place in front of the
hotel, which the last of the Rowrers’ horses had just
entered. A few curious faces were still to be seen at the
windows. The traveler, evidently thinking that all this
was in his honor, bowed all around in his satisfaction
at their welcome. As he got out of the omnibus at the
Lion d’Or, amiable smiles were awaiting him—a politeness
which he repaid with a nod, as if to say, “Greatly
flattered, believe me!”
</p>

<p>
“Him I recognize,” said Yvonne. “I saw him two or
three times in Paris. That is M. Caracal.”
</p>

<p>
But grand’mère no longer listened. She had returned
to her knitting. The place no longer interested her; too
many people were passing there. All this movement
annoyed her. Why do not people stay at home? Meanwhile
Caracal’s manœuvers were amusing Yvonne.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_283' name='Page_283' href='#Page_283'>283</a></span>
</p>

<p>
“Poor M. Caracal,” she thought; “there he is, politely
bowing to every one. Really, he seems persuaded that
they’ve all come out to welcome him! If he knew that
it was all for horses and an auto, his vanity as a writer
would be wounded.”
</p>

<p>
Yvonne sympathized with him, but she could not help
being amused at the sight of Caracal jumping about like
a puppet, giving orders about his trunks, and at last,
when the crowd had seen enough of him, entering the
Lion d’Or behind the Rowrers’ horses.

<h3>
CHAPTER II
<br />
IN CAMP
</h3>

<p>
Grand’mère de Grojean was talking about
camping out, with many an “<i>est-ce possible!</i>”
and “<i>Grand Dieu!</i>” and Mademoiselle Yvonne
was looking at the dust in the distance, while Miss Rowrer
and grandma were already inspecting their camping-ground.
</p>

<p>
“How well off we shall be here, Ethel!” grandma said.
“What a capital idea! We shall breathe freely and, in
spite of being in an old country, we shall have new
experiences. I like new things!”
</p>

<p>
It was in full July. For several weeks Miss Rowrer
had had the intention of quitting Paris. First of all, it
was hot, and there was nothing to see, now that the
Grand Prix race had been run. Besides, the national
holiday of the Fourteenth of July was drawing near,
and then the sovereign people dance and eat and drink
in the street, which is really too common!
</p>

<p>
“Let us hurry away!” Miss Rowrer said. “Let us not
take back to America a bad opinion of France. We must
not judge it by Paris. Let us go and see France at home—away
from dust and dances and noise, away from
<i>punch d’indignation</i>. The countess has invited us to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_285' name='Page_285' href='#Page_285'>285</a></span>
pass the summer in her château; with her leave, we’ll
pass it in her park. Let me arrange it.”
</p>

<p>
Miss Rowrer had chosen a hill from which you could
see the whole country-side. Then she sent for a house-furnisher,
told him her plans, saying: “I want this—and
this—and this.” The tradesman remonstrated: “But,
mademoiselle, that is never done!” She finished by
making him understand, all the same, by dint of repeating,
“I wish this! and this! and this!” At last, without
any one knowing it except M. Riçois, who paid the bills,
the camp was set up.
</p>

<p>
Several square tents, with a flooring of boards, had
been raised amid the trees. When the door-flaps were
drawn back, Japanese mats were to be seen, and, behind
dainty screens, little brass bedsteads and rocking-chairs
and toilet furniture.
</p>

<p>
The tent for Will and Phil had its beds concealed
under Algerian rugs, which made lounges for the daytime.
It served as a smoking-room for the dining-tent,
which was set up alongside very simply, with an abundance
of flowers in rustic vases. Farther back, hidden in
the shrubbery, were the kitchen and offices. Near by
there was an immense water-butt, ingeniously made to
furnish each tent with an inexhaustible supply of fresh
water. There was also a tent for the auto and for the
saddle-horses, when needed.
</p>

<p>
“It is perfect, Ethel!” grandma said, looking around.
</p>

<p>
“I am well pleased with it, my dear grandma,” Ethel
acknowledged. “It is not as good as Tent City, on
Coronado Beach at San Diego,” she added, laughing,
“but we shall be more at home here and the view is
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_286' name='Page_286' href='#Page_286'>286</a></span>
superb. How do you find it, Phil? Will, are you
pleased?” And she waved her hand to the horizon.
</p>

<p>
From their hilltop, across the river which wound below,
they saw an immense plain. Its calm beauty impressed
Ethel, fresh from noisy Paris. France had
never seemed so large to her. Among the trees there
were bell-towers rising above red roofs, and here and
there high factory-chimneys crested with smoke. It was
“the province,” wide and active and silent.
</p>

<p>
In the distance, fields stretched away to the horizon.
It was like an immense sea, with waves forever motionless.
Wagons moved across it and boats glided along the
waters of the river, and on the roads and in the fields
members of the human ant-hill were stirring everywhere.
</p>

<p>
“It is beautiful,” Phil said, “and I am grateful to
you for having invited me. Here I shall paint from
nature, and you, Miss Rowrer, ought to do delightful
water-colors.”
</p>

<p>
“What do you think of my landscape, Will?” Ethel
asked her brother, who was examining the auto.
</p>

<p>
“It’s all right—there’s something wrong with my
carbureter,” answered Will. “I’ll have to see to it at
once. I’ll look at the landscape later.”
</p>

<p>
“That’s just like Will!” Ethel remarked. “You talk
landscape to him and he answers with carbureters and
floaters and all the rest. If you only listened to him
you’d think him the most earth-bound of mechanicians.
And in his heart he is a poet—yes, a poet! He has a
little blue flower in his heart; perhaps it’s a forget-me-not!”
</p>

<p>
“The dinner-bell is ringing,” observed Will.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_287' name='Page_287' href='#Page_287'>287</a></span>
</p>

<p>
“Well, let’s to table!” Ethel said. “There’s nothing
like forty miles an hour to give one an appetite.”
</p>

<p>
The dinner was delicious. There were the country
dishes—<i>soupe blanchie</i>, artichokes and beans, an eel in
bouillon, stewed chicken and a salad, an ice and the fritters
of the province. The middle of the table was decorated
with a magnificent bouquet of roses, while all
around were wild flowers of the fields. The cook hired
by Mme. Riçois had done things well,—too well, indeed.
Over and above the flowers, the table was furnished with
as many bottles as in an inn.
</p>

<p>
“Take away those bottles of wine that litter up the
table,” Ethel said to the valet.
</p>

<p>
“But, mademoiselle, what are you going to drink?”
asked the cook, who was standing near.
</p>

<p>
“We shall drink water—with ice in it.”
</p>

<p>
“Water—with ice!”
</p>

<p>
“At every meal,” Miss Rowrer added.
</p>

<p>
“But after your ice-cream—to warm up the stomach?”
</p>

<p>
“Ice-water!” said Ethel.
</p>

<p>
Over the cook’s face there crept an expression of
terror and pity. To console her, Ethel complimented
her cookery, but the smile had vanished from the good
woman’s lips until they asked her recipe for the fritters.
</p>

<p>
“I’ll take it back to Chicago with me,” said grandma.
“We’ll give a german, and we’ll have pastry just like
that on the sideboard. It will be a novelty.”
</p>

<p>
Ethel, after the meal, pretended to light a cigarette,
to put the men at their ease. Will picked out a cigar,
and Phil, who patterned himself after Miss Rowrer, took
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_288' name='Page_288' href='#Page_288'>288</a></span>
a whiff at a cigarette and threw it away. Then he
picked up his banjo.
</p>

<p>
“Play us the ‘Arkansaw Traveler’!” grandma asked.
“The very turn of the tune makes me wish to dance.”
</p>

<p>
Ethel spoke up: “What if we should map out our
time for the two months we are to spend here? We
have, first, the invitation from the countess and her
friends—there are a <i>rallye-paper</i> and a <i>chasse à courre</i>.”
</p>

<p>
“The hunt is much later—a few days before we leave
for Morgania,” observed Will.
</p>

<p>
“The good duke!” said Ethel; “it seems things
are not going at all well in his country. Who knows?
By the time we get to Morgania there may be neither
duke nor duchy!”
</p>

<p>
“I’d rather be a trapper in the far West than a duke
in such a country,” said grandma.
</p>

<p>
“As for me,” said Phil, stopping short the “Arkansaw
Traveler,” which he had been strumming lightly, “my
picture is already there and I must put it up and retouch
it on the spot. I shall go, whatever happens.”
</p>

<p>
“Bravo!” Ethel answered. “‘Whatever happens’!
That’s talking! One ought to know what one has
to do, and then do it, whatever happens! But that has
nothing to do with our camp,” she went on, as she
poured out a lemon squash. We must see the Grojeans.
I do hope dear Yvonne will come and sketch with me;
and we must visit the country fair,—they tell me it is
very curious. And then there will be our excursions, and
photographs for our albums; and I must take a good
deal of exercise. There are so many things to see that
we shall have no time to bore ourselves.”
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_289' name='Page_289' href='#Page_289'>289</a></span>
</p>

<p>
The next day they completed the setting up of the
camp. Ethel christened it “Camp Rosemont,” looked
over it with the eye of the master, and arranged
everything for the meals. She had a flag-pole planted
for the Stars and Stripes. The rumor ran through
the country that circus people had come and were camping
under a tent in the open. Curious villagers came
and looked on from a distance, stretching out their
necks.
</p>

<p>
“Let the children come!” Ethel said. She stuffed
them with sweetmeats, spreading bread and butter with
jelly for them with her own hands. The little girls
amused her most, with their braided hair and simple
gowns and little wooden shoes. She met an inborn politeness
in them—the refinement of ancient days; they curtsied
to her.
</p>

<p>
“You’d say they were fresh from the company of
princesses,” was Ethel’s appreciation. True enough,
their games, the <i>volant</i>, the <i>grâces</i>, the dancing in
a round, and the songs, in which they spoke of ladies
and princes and knights, all told of the olden time of
joust and tournament.
</p>

<p>
“How nice you all are,” Ethel said to them. “Will
you come often? You are not afraid of me?”
</p>

<p>
“Oh, no, mademoiselle!”
</p>

<p>
“Bring your little playmates. I shall always have
cakes for you.”
</p>

<p>
“Oh, no, mademoiselle!”
</p>

<p>
“What! You do not wish to eat my cakes?”
</p>

<p>
“Oh, not every day! Our parents would scold us!
But you can tell us nice stories, and then you might give
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_290' name='Page_290' href='#Page_290'>290</a></span>
us tickets for the circus. You must look pretty when
you go riding horseback.”
</p>

<p>
“So you think I’m a circus-rider?”
</p>

<p>
“That’s what people say.”
</p>

<p>
“Well, they are mistaken. I am,—I am”—Ethel
did not find it easy to say just what she was. She
could not say, “I am a painter,” or, “I am a musician.”
So she contented herself with saying, “I am an American!”
</p>

<p>
“America—that is a country. Is it farther than
Paris?”
</p>

<p>
“Oh, yes!”
</p>

<p>
“My papa has a machine to mow hay which comes
from Chicago. Is that a city? Is it as big as the city
yonder?”
</p>

<p>
“It is as big as all that!” Ethel said, opening her
arms to the boundless horizon. “And three times as high
as the tallest tree.”
</p>

<p>
“My papa has been in Buenos Aires. Perhaps you
saw him there?”
</p>

<p>
“Never.”
</p>

<p>
“You were never bitten by serpents?”
</p>

<p>
“Never.”
</p>

<p>
“Does everybody in your country sleep under tents
as you do?”
</p>

<p>
“No; but in big, big houses.”
</p>

<p>
“That must be fine.”
</p>

<p>
“I’ll show you pictures, children, and tell you stories
of my country and pretty stories of yours, too. Do you
love your country very much?”
</p>

<p>
“France? Oh, yes!”

<p>
“You are right, darlings, and I love it also. It is a
beautiful country, which we all love in America. But
we sha’n’t be friends any longer if you won’t eat my
cakes.”
</p>

<p>
“Oh, yes, mademoiselle!”
</p>

<p>
Ringing laughter followed, and they ate the cakes, and
there were games, and dances in which there was something
of the majestic minuet and something of the light
gavotte.
</p>

<p>
“It does me good to see how happy they are,” Ethel
said to herself. “Oh, how I should like to have all the
world happy forever!”
</p>

<p>
They were to visit the Grojeans later, when everything
should be finished at the camp. The countess had not
yet arrived at her château, and Ethel profited by this
to explore the country round about. Phil and Will, and
even Caracal, who was living at the hotel, from time to
time accompanied them. They made sketches and water-colors
and talked over their impressions. In her walks
Ethel wore a gray serge skirt adorned with large plaits,
a bolero of the same stuff edged with white, silk shirt-waist,
and a white straw hat; and with that she went up
hill and down dale with the readiness of a college boy.
</p>

<p>
They saw France at home. The endless parceling out
of properties and labor astonished them. Every one was
half peasant and half workman, and had his own house
and fields and vineyards. Thanks to the spirit of saving,
want was unknown; and the variety of work made anything
like a dead season impossible. When the workshop
closed its doors, the workman took up his spade and
cultivated his garden.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_294' name='Page_294' href='#Page_294'>294</a></span>
</p>

<p>
“I had no idea of anything like this,” Will said, with
deep interest. What a rest for him, who had just left
Chicago and the business strife, to find himself in the
open country, where everything smiled around him!
</p>

<p>
Sometimes they met a wedding-party on the way—the
bride in white, the groom in black, the old men in their
blouses. A fiddler, the village barber, marched at the
head, scraping out airs of the good old time.
</p>

<p>
They talked with housewives who were twirling their
spindles on the threshold. They were asked to enter,
and saw the great chimney with its fire-dogs, on which the
soup was heating, and the dresser with its colored crockery
shining in the shadow. Chickens pecked at their
feet. When Phil and Will sat down at the old oaken
table to taste the <i>piquette</i> (light wine) a familiar magpie
perched on their shoulders and asked its share.
</p>

<p>
Issuing forth, they met the “priest-eater” of the village
offering a pinch of snuff to Monsieur le Curé. Boys
were coming back from school, shouting and rattling
military marches on imaginary drums. For the girls
were dancing and the boys playing their soldier-games,
just as in the days of yore, when only the brave deserved
the fair.
</p>

<p>
On the village signs, names and trades bore witness to
the antiquity of the race and the power of its traditions.
</p>

<p>
“What dignity there is in this people!” Ethel said
to Will. “See the old goodman there, with his spade
on his shoulder, how he saluted us as he passed by. Our
people would think it servility, but it is far from that;
it is like the refined greeting of a marquis who does the
honors of his land.”
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_295' name='Page_295' href='#Page_295'>295</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Will thought long over this. All these villages were
the same now as they had been in other days. They had
always been the refuge of simple ideas, and brave hearts
had been born and had died in them, content to consider
the smoke of the horizon only from afar. These lowly
lives had passed between the old church and the little
cemetery on the hill, with its cypresses among the tombs.
</p>

<p>
“Yes, here we breathe to the full filial piety and
the reverence of forefathers,” Ethel said. “There is
something good in all that, you know. You are right,
M. Caracal, to prepare a romance on this country life.
It’s a beautiful subject and full of striking pictures.
Look at that village before us, with its gardens cut by
a network of hedges and walls, and at the roofs pressed
one against the other as if they were afraid of the horizon,
and the smoke mounting straight up to the sky.”
</p>

<p>
“But all that smells of the stable,” Caracal murmured,
“the country—<i>pouah</i>!”
</p>

<p>
“It doesn’t smell so strong as your Montmartre
cafés,” Phil whispered in his ear.
</p>

<p>
For his part, Phil was living strange days. The valley
and hill and the woods he looked at mechanically, thinking
of Miss Rowrer the while. The deep charm of the
young woman possessed him more and more; he no
longer tried to resist it. She had taken possession of him
without knowing it. Her mind was large, cosmopolitan,
human. All Phil’s happiness was now in being at her
disposition, in living near her, and seeing and hearing
her. He felt that he grew morally in her presence, and
he was more in love with her soul than with her beauty.
When he walked through the country with her, he fancied
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_296' name='Page_296' href='#Page_296'>296</a></span>
that Columbia herself was at his side, explaining
France to him.
</p>

<p>
The feeling of his littleness in her presence gave him
pain. He could not imagine himself letting her know
what he felt, either by word or gesture—he would never
dare. She was too immensely rich. Ah! if he only could,
he would give all the riches of the world that she might
be poor!
</p>

<p>
It was especially when evening came, with its melancholy,
that such thoughts arose in him. One night, after
dinner, Phil, to please grandma, took his banjo and
played the “Arkansaw Traveler.” The perfume of
roses filled the tent, which was lighted dimly. The raised
canvas showed a cloudless sky; the stars were rising and
the crystal notes of the banjo were lost in the great
silence.
</p>

<p>
“What a beautiful night!” said Ethel, “and how
calm! It is like the infinite.”
</p>

<p>
“But what are we in it all?” said Phil. “In a hundred
years nothing of all this will remain; a new mankind
will take the place of our own. We count no more
than the flower or the drop of water.”
</p>

<p>
“No,” Miss Rowrer answered; “I am more than a
drop of water, and more than a blade of grass. How,
Phil, can you speak that way? As for me, there are
times when I feel myself the equal of the whole world.”
</p>

<p>
“Miss Rowrer,” said Phil, “the whole world itself is
nothing to the infinite.”
</p>

<p class="caption">Phil Listening to Ethel</p>
</div>

<p>
“And I say,” replied the young girl, “that the end
and aim of this whole boundless universe is the production
and development of the soul, or, if you prefer it
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_297' name='Page_297' href='#Page_297'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_298' name='Page_298' href='#Page_298'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_299' name='Page_299' href='#Page_299'>299</a></span>
that way, of consciousness in man’s perishable body.
How do you know that Alfred Russel Wallace is not
right when he supposes the earth to be the center of the
universe? The Bible always said so. What if science
should prove it?”
</p>

<p>
“Frankly, now,” remarked Will, who was smoking a
bad cigar (and yet the brand bore his name—it was
enough to disgust one with earthly grandeur) “frankly
now, Ethel, can you suppose these little creatures that
we are—”
</p>

<p>
“But I will not be a little creature!” cried Ethel.
“The telescope seems to show that there is no such
thing as an infinity of suns. Limited as they must be
in number, they only form what is called a globular agglomeration,
concentric with the Milky Way. I read
that the other day. Our solar system is in the center of
this agglomeration and so in the center of the Milky Way,
which we see around us like a circle. And beyond, there
is, perhaps, nothing at all. Our solar system is, then, in
the center of the material universe; and this earth of ours—that
which is nothing to the infinite, according to
Phil—on the contrary, occupies so privileged a place
near its central sun that here only, it is probable, life can
have been developed and man created, and so the whole
universe must have its fulfilment in us! What do you
think of such a theory? I had rather believe that than be
only a flower or a drop of water,” Ethel concluded, as
she arose.
</p>

<p>
From his corner in the shadow Phil saw her, in the full
light of the lamp, standing out luminous against the dark
horizon as if mingled with the stars. He admired her
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_300' name='Page_300' href='#Page_300'>300</a></span>
superb self-confidence—why should he doubt himself?
He vowed that before their departure for Morgania he
would let Miss Rowrer know his feelings for her. Perhaps
she suspected them a little. No matter, he would
tell her! As an extreme limit, so much did he feel the
need of binding himself, he fixed the time for his declaration
at the stag hunt.

<h3>
CHAPTER III
<br />
GRAND’MÈRE VERSUS GRANDMA
</h3>

<p>
“I thought the Grojeans were absent—their house
has been all the time shut up,” Caracal said to
Ethel; “but I caught sight of them yesterday.
They must be back.”
</p>

<p>
“We’ll go to-day and invite them to tennis,” Ethel
said. “It will give so much pleasure to Mademoiselle
Yvonne—and perhaps Will might be glad to see her
again,” Ethel added to herself.
</p>

<p>
In the afternoon the auto, in all its splendor, flew
along the way to the home of the Grojeans.
</p>

<p>
Caracal was delighted. Miss Rowrer had been very
gracious to him. He would have gone oftener to Camp
Rosemont, but he had been content to shine from afar
on account of the drafts and mosquitos under the accursed
tents. He kept to his lodgings at the Lion d’Or,
a little inn full of flies and smelling of cabbage-soup.
</p>

<p>
“What a beautiful road this is!” Ethel observed.
“You would say it was an avenue in a park, everything
has such a refined air, so prinked and pretty,
with its flowers set here and there!”
</p>

<p>
Every one was impressed by the gardens of flowers
and the finished, distinguished look of everything. Will
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_302' name='Page_302' href='#Page_302'>302</a></span>
had the deepest enjoyment of it. His head may have
been full of business, he may have handled his millions
in his sleep, but he felt himself taken by this provincial
charm. His love for it was the love of that which contrasts
with one’s self. When he saw the hills crowned
with oak and the inclosures bordered with roses, the
variegated fields alive with vine and corn, a sweet
country and a strong one, whose people greeted him
with smiles, he seemed to forget all care, to be reading
a poem.
</p>

<p>
“Will,” Ethel remarked, “is in love with France.”
</p>

<p>
Caracal kept his impressions to himself. A loftier
anxiety was weighing on him: “The House of Glass” was
about to appear. It was a thunderbolt which would soon
burst and he would be famous; and, after the town, the
country should have its turn! His work should be the
life-encyclopedia of our day. He already had notes on
the mosquitos, remarks on the grunting of pigs in their
sties and the smells of the manure-heap. His novel would
begin well.
</p>

<p>
“Tell me, M. Caracal,” Ethel chanced to ask just
as he was thinking of all this, “have you found a
title for your novel on country life which we were talking
about the other day?”
</p>

<p>
“I am hunting for one, Miss Rowrer,” answered Caracal.
</p>

<p>
“I hope every one will be allowed to read it, even
young girls,” she went on.
</p>

<p>
“Ah—” Caracal interrupted.
</p>

<p>
“Good!” Ethel said, “why should unpleasant things
be written? Very dirty things some authors write, so
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_303' name='Page_303' href='#Page_303'>303</a></span>
I hear it said. I don’t understand this fouling of one’s
own nest.”
</p>

<p>
Caracal hid his chagrin. To him a novel for the
“young person”—a “proper” novel—was the lowest
term of contempt. No, his would not be a rose-colored romance;
it would be something that had been lived, thrilling
with human passion, bleeding and fierce, even if it
smelled of the stable and dung-hill—ah!—and he turned
his Mephistophelian eye-glass toward the horizon.
</p>

<p>
A writer for young persons! The indignation which
dictated his verses to Juvenal made Caracal find a title
for his romance. “Let’s see,” he thought. “In fact,
what title shall I give it? It must be something suggestive.
For the city I have ‘The House of Glass’; would
‘The Pigsty’ do for the country? No, they’d say it was
a treatise on breeding. ‘The Rose on the Dung-Hill’?
No, they’d say it was poetry. ‘Dung-Hill’ alone is too
short. ‘Worms from the Dung-Hill’—that’s the thing!
comparing the country to a vast manure-heap with
worms crawling through it.”
</p>

<p>
Secretly satisfied with this stroke of his genius, Caracal
rubbed his hands.
</p>

<p>
As they drew near the town, the houses, scattered at
first and amid gardens, became more numerous. The
camping-party now jolted over the “King’s Pavement.”
At a distance, above the low roofs, the spires of a church
were seen. All at once they came out in the place where
a few days before, through the blinds, when the sun-fountain
marked four o’clock, the Grojeans had watched
their passing by.
</p>

<p>
“The Grojean house?” A person standing near
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_304' name='Page_304' href='#Page_304'>304</a></span>
answered their inquiry: “It is the great doorway beyond
there opening on the place.”
</p>

<p>
Brrr! and the auto was in front of the house.
</p>

<p>
There was a great door, studded with big iron nails,
and a little wicket, with a grating in front of it, opening
in the thickness of the wood. The front of the house,
smooth and with drawn blinds, had a venerable look.
The stroke of the knocker resounded long, as if re-echoing
through an empty house. A moment passed.
</p>

<p>
They had time to notice the fine grass which grew between
the stones of the walk and the foot of the wall, and
the old escutcheon carved above the door.
</p>

<p>
“It is the Grojeans’ coat of arms,” Ethel explained
in a low voice. “They belonged to the old <i>noblesse
de robe</i>. One grandfather was a presiding judge, another
was a chancellor.”
</p>

<p>
Just then the noise of the bolt was heard, the heavy
door opened, and Mlle. de Grojean welcomed them on the
threshold.
</p>

<p>
“I am delighted! What a pleasant surprise! You
must excuse me for receiving you as I am. The servants
have gone out and I was at work.”
</p>

<p>
“But you are charming as you are!” answered Ethel.
</p>

<p>
Mlle. Yvonne was certainly very pretty in her bib and
apron, with her graceful neck issuing from the wide
white collar, and her refined head, with its hair rolled
like a helmet above it.
</p>

<p>
“Do come in!” she exclaimed.
</p>

<p>
The hallway, paved with marble, and with its lofty
ceiling, surprised them by its coolness. To right and left
there were double doors. At one side rose a great stone
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_305' name='Page_305' href='#Page_305'>305</a></span>
staircase with an iron railing and without carpet. On the
wall there were a few old pictures, and these, with two
benches of the time of Charles X, formed the furniture of
the hall. At the foot, through a glass door, there was a
view on a terrace leading down to the garden.
</p>

<p>
“Grand’mère, here are my Paris friends,” Mlle.
Yvonne said, as she brought the party into the salon:
“Mme. Rowrer, Miss Rowrer, Monsieur William, Monsieur
Phil Longwill.”
</p>

<p>
Caracal kept himself to one side, smiling as if it were
understood that he, a celebrated man, was superior to
these poor children of the soil.
</p>

<p>
“M. Caracal, of Paris,” Miss Rowrer said, presenting
him. “M. Caracal has come to study the country. He
is preparing a book.”
</p>

<p>
“Ah! Monsieur is a professor of agriculture. You
are welcome, monsieur,” grand’mère said, with simplicity,
leaving Caracal to that isolation which is the lot of
psychologues once they leave the Boulevard.
</p>

<p>
“I shall surely put you into my novel!” Caracal muttered
to himself, in his vexation.
</p>

<p>
“If I had known, I would have taken the covers from
the chairs,” said Mlle. Yvonne. “But sit down all the
same, I beg of you. Mama will be very glad to see you.
She is coming back. I will go fetch her.”
</p>

<p>
“Don’t mind, Yvonne,” said Ethel; “we will wait.
You know,” she added, “everything is delightful to us
here.”
</p>

<p>
There was the same dim light on the silken hangings
and the furniture, reflecting its brasses. The air was
fine and sweet, like the fragrance of the caskets of our
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_306' name='Page_306' href='#Page_306'>306</a></span>
grandmothers in family store-rooms. Through the windows,
half open on the garden, they could hear the song
of birds amid the groves.
</p>

<p>
Mme. de Grojean now came in. The chairs were
moved from their formal rows and every one sat down.
Conversation began.
</p>

<p>
The perfectly natural manners and air of high distinction
of Mlle. Yvonne and Mme. de Grojean, found in the
midst of their domestic occupations, were a pleasure to
Will.
</p>

<p>
“You were working at this water-color?” Ethel asked
of Mlle. Yvonne.
</p>

<p>
“No. I’m going to send that to a charity bazaar; but
I was working at this.”
</p>

<p>
“This muslin gown?”
</p>

<p>
“Not just now,” said Yvonne, “I was scraping
lint.”
</p>

<p>
“Lint! For what?”
</p>

<p>
“Why, for some expedition they are preparing; for
the next war.”
</p>

<p>
Will and Ethel were in admiration at such simplicity
of life, in which young girls sewed at their own muslin
gowns for the yearly ball, and varied their employment
by picking lint for the next war.
</p>

<p>
“Just imagine!” Ethel said to herself. “I pitied
her in Paris because she never went anywhere! Quite
the contrary, she must have been having a thoroughly
good time. Those days must have been regular escapades,
an excess of liberty, compared to this life of
work and obscure duties.”
</p>

<p>
She looked in turn at Yvonne, in her high spirits, at
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_307' name='Page_307' href='#Page_307'>307</a></span>
her mother, who was so self-effacing, and at the rigid,
conservative, severe grandmother.
</p>

<p>
“Have you many amusements here?” Ethel asked.
“A theater, books, fine walks?”
</p>

<p>
“Oh!” answered Yvonne, “we hardly go to the theater—once
or twice a year, perhaps—and we receive few
books, we have so little time to read. But amusements
are not wanting, I assure you. Sometimes I go to market,
and there’s the care of the house, with preserves to
make; there are the garden and the fruits. We must
have an eye to everything.”
</p>

<p>
“Yvonne is very whimsical, too,” said grand’mère;
“she wanted some canary birds! Nowadays, young girls
have nothing but pleasure in their heads!”
</p>

<p>
“But birds are so amusing,” replied Yvonne. “Just
now,” she added, “we are in a hurry with our gift to
the soldiers—there are lint, preserves and tobacco and
liqueurs, and linen to send them. We have a committee
here, and we occupy ourselves with it at our monthly
meetings. And when it isn’t that, it’s something else.
My cousin Henri accompanies me at the piano, or I read
French history or some treatise on education. I haven’t
a minute to myself, especially here, because grand’mère
is the president of the committee.”
</p>

<p>
“Alas! what a different idea of the Frenchwoman
psychological novelists have been giving!” was Phil’s
thought as he looked at Caracal, with his monocle glistening
in the shadow.
</p>

<p>
“In your place, madame,” said grandma, speaking
directly to grand’mère, “I’d start a committee for general
disarmament.”
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_308' name='Page_308' href='#Page_308'>308</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Mme. de Grojean opened her eyes wide. Ethel, who
saw the effect which had been produced, hastened to
say, “Grandma is joking.”
</p>

<p>
“Not at all, Ethel,” replied grandma. “The country
is very pretty, with its flowers and its soldiers; but I
prefer our Western plains, and I’d give all the military
music in the world for our peaceful tunes.”
</p>

<p>
Grand’mère and grandma were face to face; they
formed a perfect contrast to each other.

<p>
Grandma seemed to have in her clear eyes the sheen
of the sea and of the prairies, where new dawns had
arisen for her. Incredible energy could be read on her
nervous features. One would have said that she was
still young and active, and full of ambition; and, if she
was able to talk with grand’mère, it was because during
the past months she had begun again to speak and read
French with as much ardor as a school-girl. She did
not feel herself growing old so long as she improved herself.
She detested things which never changed, homes
too shut in, too hushed a silence, and too passive obedience.
Leaning forward, she looked into the eyes of
grand’mère. The latter was the majestic representative
of changeless things, of tradition that must not be
touched. Of what use is it to learn so much, since all
sin comes from knowledge? And why change, since all
through the centuries men have gone to war, while women
stayed at home and spun.
</p>

<p>
Seated squarely back in her arm-chair, she looked like
a tower of the Middle Ages, ready for the assault. She
prepared her batteries and took from her arsenal replies
a thousand years old, with which to overwhelm the assailant.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_309' name='Page_309' href='#Page_309'>309</a></span>
To grandma asking, “Why not change?”
grand’mère would answer, “What use to change?”
</p>

<p>
She had the proverbs of her ancestors all in line.
Against the taste for travel she could throw this bomb:
“Each in his place!” She would stifle the spirit of
adventure with “A rolling stone gathers no moss!”
Against the pursuit of progress her ammunition was
ready: “The better is the enemy of the good.” And the
daring ones who would attempt to climb up, in the name
of modern ambition and equality for all, would receive
from her mitrailleuse: “There was a frog who tried to
become as big as an ox, and who burst in the endeavor!”
</p>

<p>
Last of all, if the enemy should really force a way
into the stronghold, she had the crushing reply: “<i>Ça ne
se fait pas</i> [It isn’t done]!”
</p>

<p>
But grandma was not to be intimidated, and her best
argument was Ethel herself.
</p>

<p>
“In America,” said grandma, “we haven’t the same
idea of education. It’s the young girl’s Paradise!”
</p>

<p>
“But I am very happy here,” Yvonne said, smiling.
</p>

<p>
“Ignorance is bliss,” grandma thought to herself.
</p>

<p>
“With us,” Ethel said aloud, “a young girl like
Yvonne, who has a taste for painting, would go to Paris
to study.”
</p>

<p>
“Ah! <i>Seigneur!</i> how could you imagine my going to
live in Paris at my age!” exclaimed Yvonne’s mother.
</p>

<p>
“But you would remain here,” grandma said. “Your
daughter would go alone.”
</p>

<p>
“<i>Est-il possible!</i>” grand’mère exclaimed.
</p>

<p>
“It is so pleasant,” grandma went on, “to have the
whole world before you; it is so exciting to be in the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_310' name='Page_310' href='#Page_310'>310</a></span>
strife and to feel one’s self alive at twenty. It is done
every day with us and we are none the worse for it. On
the contrary—”
</p>

<p>
“That I can see,” grand’mère admitted, looking at
Ethel. Grand’mère found her charming, and could not
understand how a young girl brought up with such liberty
should be so nice.
</p>

<p>
Grandma continued: “The will ought to develop itself
freely, just like the body. Women must know how to deliberate,
to be fit companions for strong men; and a
young girl ought to have some experience of life to make
her way later and to choose her husband.”
</p>

<p>
“To choose a husband!” grand’mère cried; “but I
suppose that is the parents’ concern?”
</p>

<p>
“Well, I declare!” was the answer of grandma, who
did not declare often.
</p>

<p>
Yvonne was beginning to ask herself whether, since
they were talking of husbands, they would not, quite by
chance, send her to look for something which had been
forgotten on the garden bench.
</p>

<p>
Ethel, to get away from the subject, spoke up: “Mme.
de Grojean, I have a great favor to ask of you.”
</p>

<p>
“I grant it in advance,” said Mme. Grojean.
</p>

<p>
“It is this,” said Ethel. “We are camping in the
grounds of the Comtesse de Donjeon. Oh! the establishment
is quite simple, and more agreeable than a hotel, I
assure you. We go fishing and walking and painting;
we play the banjo. It is so pleasant to live in the open
air, and I would be so glad if Yvonne could come with
us. We should amuse ourselves so much.”
</p>

</div>

<p>
“And it would be so good to have these young people
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_311' name='Page_311' href='#Page_311'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_312' name='Page_312' href='#Page_312'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_313' name='Page_313' href='#Page_313'>313</a></span>
around me,” grandma added. “I love life and movement.”
</p>

<p>
“We shall go about the country in our auto,” Ethel
continued. “We shall get up picnics, we shall have
impromptu plays, with lanterns, when we have guests of
an evening; and I count on Yvonne, Mme. de Grojean.
It is granted in advance!”
</p>

<p>
“I should like it, if mama pleases,” ventured Yvonne,
with a blush of pleasure.
</p>

<p>
“It is for grand’mère to decide, my dear Yvonne. Ask
grand’mère. I am willing, if she is.”
</p>

<p>
The judge was about to pronounce. She meditated
a moment. Mme. Rowrer and Miss Ethel were very kind,
it was true. But would they always be present to look
after Yvonne? Might not Yvonne sometimes go out alone
with Monsieur William or Monsieur Phil? Her granddaughter
walking with men! She hesitated no longer.
</p>

<p>
“It is impossible,” she said. “I thank you very much,
Mlle. Rowrer, but it is impossible.”
</p>

<p>
The judge had pronounced, without appeal!
</p>

<p>
“Ah!” thought Ethel, “I understand how a young
girl in France should take the husband they choose for
her with eyes shut. It is to her own interest to escape
from such family tyranny.”
</p>

<p>
“But we shall go to see Miss Ethel?” Yvonne asked.
</p>

<p>
“Oh, certainly! We shall go to pass an afternoon
with you,” Mme. de Grojean said, encouraged by an indulgent
smile from grand’mère, who, seated squarely in
her arm-chair, murmured between her lips:
</p>

<p>
“Ah! how insatiable for pleasure young people are
nowadays! As if birds and flowers in the garden were
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_314' name='Page_314' href='#Page_314'>314</a></span>
not enough! Soon we shall have girls playing like boys;
they will talk of the theater and sport, of tennis and bicycles—horror!”
</p>

<p>
Yvonne, gay as usual, and without any expression of
bitterness, spoke low with her grandmother.
</p>

<p>
“Grand’mère, what if I should prepare a light collation
for our visitors?”
</p>

<p>
“You are right, my child,” said grand’mère; “here is
the key of the preserve pantry.”
</p>

<p>
Every one was now talking. A visitor had just made
her appearance—Mme. Riçois, the banker’s wife, alert
and dimpling, as usual. Phil, Will, and Mme. de Grojean
talked pleasantly together. Caracal, with an air of
great importance, talked of bric-à-brac to Mme. Riçois.
Grand’mère and grandma made peace together. They
found an admirable common ground of interest. Grand’mère
showed grandma, who looked at them like a connoisseur,
the photographs of her grandchildren, boys and
girls, and grand-nephews and -nieces. Grandma gave
grand’mère a recipe for home-made pie.
</p>

<p>
“The collation is ready,” Yvonne said, as she opened
from without one of the long windows on the terrace.
Her joyful voice sounded through the salon as the floods
of light came in with the perfume of mignonette and
roses.
</p>

<p>
“Grand’mère,” Yvonne went on, “I have spread the
collation under the arbor by the waterside. Is that
right?”
</p>

<p>
“You have done well, my child,” said grand’mère.
</p>

<p>
Mlle. Yvonne smiled with pride, like a soldier receiving
his general’s compliment. Without any more ado, they
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_315' name='Page_315' href='#Page_315'>315</a></span>
all crossed the terrace and went down into the garden.
It stretched out with straight alleys bordered by cut box;
and at each side thick trees isolated it from the rest of
the world. In the center there was a little basin of rockwork.
At the bottom of the garden, along the riverside,
a trellis-work formed a shady arbor—a nook of dainty
freshness. As they went down to it Yvonne threw
bread-crumbs to the goldfish in the basin, and then
showed her flower-borders, in which the blue and white
and red blossoms were like a tricolor flag.
</p>

<p>
“I water them myself,” said Yvonne.
</p>

<p>
The table was spread under a trellis covered with
honeysuckle. There were biscuits and preserves, fruits,
cool water, liqueurs and wine and beer—all set out in
perfect taste.
</p>

<p>
Yvonne served every one.
</p>

<p>
“Did you prepare all this yourself?” Ethel asked, in
wonder. “And you also found time to adorn the table
with flowers—you are a real fairy!”
</p>

<p>
A balustrade, over which ivy was growing, separated
them from the river. On the other side of the water
there spread out a vast plain, in which factory-chimneys
were smoking.
</p>

<p>
“Only look at the contrast!” Ethel said, pointing to
the plain across the river. “You would say it was
America; while here, in this old garden, surrounded by
walls, with Yvonne beside her flower-beds and all these
savory fruits and beautiful golden grapes on their palings,
I seem to be looking at old France!”
</p>

<p>
“Here’s to France!” Will said, lifting his glass, full
of clear water.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_316' name='Page_316' href='#Page_316'>316</a></span>
</p>

<p>
“To America!” Yvonne replied, pouring out for herself
a little white wine.
</p>

<p>
“To our alliance!” said the alert and dimpling Mme.
Riçois, as she tossed down her glass of champagne, while
the rest of the party, including grandma and grand’mère,
gaily attacked the cakes and fruits.
</p>

<p>
“It’s understood, then, isn’t it, madame?” Ethel
said to grand’mère, “we can count on Yvonne for an
afternoon, and, if you are willing, we shall go together
to see the fair.”
</p>

<p>
“It is understood,” answered grand’mère; “and we
will go into the booths and the circus, too—and you must
come also, Mme. Riçois. It will be a fête-day for us!”
</p>

<p>
“With pleasure,” said Mme. Riçois, filling her glass
again in honor of the alliance.

<h3>
CHAPTER IV
<br />
THROUGH THE COUNTRY FAIR
</h3>

<p>
The camping-party and the Grojeans were doing
the fair. At the foot of the platform, before the
circus door, an open-mouthed circle listened to
the girl-clown dressed as Pierrette. All around, under the
burning sun, tents had been set up, painted in bright
colors. Groaning trombones proclaimed the wrestlers
and the bearded woman. Other mountebanks farther on
attracted the public toward their own side-shows. To
the notes of an orchestrion, wooden horses turned rigidly
against a cotton-print background, spangled with mirrors.
Cries and laughter were heard above all the rumbling
of the drums. Far and wide rose the discordant
noise, especially that of the market for domestic animals,
where the high “do” of squealing pigs quite mastered
the muffled bass of the oxen.
</p>

<p>
Everywhere there was something to see. But the
Pierrette was so pretty that the public disdained the
rest and thronged around her, fascinated by her air of
good-fellowship, and her young, fresh laughter.
</p>

<p>
“Now’s the time! Now’s the time!” the Pierrette
cried, while, behind her on the platform, circus-riders
and clowns, and the master in person, Signor Perbaccho,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_318' name='Page_318' href='#Page_318'>318</a></span>
listened gravely to her. “Come in! Come in! Let us
show you an animal that has been well trained—but
not without difficulty, for he is stupid enough to make
soup of smoked beetles!
</p>

<p>
“Oh, you needn’t think it just happened!” the Pierrette
ran on, making gestures with her stick. “To begin
with, such animals exist only in Paris—Paris on the
Seine, you understand; a big village where all the pebbles
are diamonds and the trees are gold, but you don’t
dig potatoes there! To live there your loafers have
to become sculptors and painters and musicians. Their
heads are as empty as their stomachs! Mesdames et
messieurs, I am going to show you one of those animals.
Don’t throw him anything, I beseech you—no
bread-crusts, no cabbage-leaves; he ate yesterday! Attention!
Here he comes! Come hither, my fly-killer!
Come when you are called.”
</p>

<p>
There were bursts of laughter as the Pierrette
stretched out her arm and seized a man by the ear,
whirling him around and bringing him, ashamed enough,
to face the public. She might have been a marquise
disguised as a soubrette, playing in comedy with a
clumsy rustic. The man turned red as a tomato.
</p>

<p>
“Have you made your bread-winner shine to-day?
Did you scrub it with pumice powder? Answer!” said
the Pierrette.
</p>

<p>
“Yes!” grunted the man, shaking his head like a bear.
</p>

<p>
“Let’s see!”
</p>

<p>
The man took off his hat, showing a skull of dazzling
whiteness, shining above his hairy brown face like a
piece of crockery on a cocoanut.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_319' name='Page_319' href='#Page_319'>319</a></span>
</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p class="caption">Suzanne and Poufaille at the Country Fair</p>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_320' name='Page_320' href='#Page_320'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_321' name='Page_321' href='#Page_321'>321</a></span>
</p>

<p>
“Bow to the honorable company!” said the Pierrette.
“Not so low! if they see your skull that way, they’ll
think your breeches are torn at the knee. Now, stand
up! To work, old fly-killer!
</p>

<p>
“Mesdames et messieurs,” the Pierrette said, pretending
to roll up her sleeves and get her stick ready, “it’s
not so easy as that to kill flies—unless your breath has
alcohol enough in it to make them fall in a fit! As for
me, I have discovered the means, without drinking, to
rid myself of the treacherous gluttonous flies! Do you
want my recipe? Here it is. You take a bald-headed
man, very delicately—there! like that!—you spread
on a layer of molasses and bird-lime, and then flies
and wasps, mosquitos and gnats, every insect with a
sucker, will light down on the human fly-trap; and then,—then,
mesdames,—I address my words to you!—you
take a broomstick and hit hard where the molasses is
thickest! There! like that! <i>Aïe donc! vlan! pan!</i> till
the flies are a jelly—<i>pan! pan!</i>—hit him again! that’s
the way to kill flies and treat men as they deserve—with
a broomstick—<i>et aïe donc</i>!”
</p>

<p>
“What! Suzanne and Poufaille!” exclaimed Phil,
getting nearer the platform. The camping-party, followed
by the Grojeans, joined him just as Poufaille,
covered with molasses and shame, escaped from his executioner
and dived back behind the canvas. Suzanne,
full of excitement from her bastinade, stamped her feet,
and with voice and gesture invited the public to come up
and buy their places. High above the noise of the band
her piercing voice called out the program:
</p>

<p>
“Riding of the <i>haute école</i> by the celebrated Perbaccho!
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_322' name='Page_322' href='#Page_322'>322</a></span>
The dance of the sylphs by Mademoiselle Suzanne,
pupil of the famous Helia! Hercules O’Poufaille,
of the family of O’Poufailles! Come in! Come in!”
</p>

<p>
Phil was greatly astonished. He had not seen Poufaille
since the evening when the latter, with his
eyes starting from his head, had cast at him the terrible
accusation—“You have stolen from me my share
of glory!”
</p>

<p>
“So he’s made himself a Hercules of the fair,”
thought Phil, “and he’s made his name Irish! What a
fall for an <i>autochtone</i>!”
</p>

<p>
“Phil,” asked Ethel, who had stopped in front of
the Pierrette, “wouldn’t you say it was Suzanne?
And here on the poster is O’Poufaille—it must be M.
Poufaille! Decidedly, Tout-Paris has given itself a rendezvous
in the provinces!”
</p>

<p>
“What—do you know those people?” grand’mère
asked of Ethel. “I suppose you saw them in some circus!”
</p>

<p>
“I saw them in Paris—at the Louvre and at Monsieur
Phil’s studio. They are good, brave hearts. Suzanne
has posed for me and so did the famous Helia, whose
portrait Yvonne did.”
</p>

<p>
“Impossible!”
</p>

<p>
“Why, yes, grand’mère,” Yvonne said. “That head
of a Madonna—the miniature which you keep on your
prie-dieu, don’t you know?—Mlle. Helia posed for it.”
</p>

<p>
“A Madonna copied from devils like that?” gasped
grand’mère, amazed at the Pierrette’s gesticulations on
the platform. “What! you bring such people into your
house! You are not afraid?”
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_323' name='Page_323' href='#Page_323'>323</a></span>
</p>

<p>
“I?” answered Ethel; “no fear at all! I would give
them the key of my desk! Mme. Grojean, only ask Monsieur
Phil, who knows them better than I. Every one
earns his living as he can. Each one has his trade—and
God for us all!”
</p>

<p>
“When you go to see them—for I hope you are going
to see them,” Ethel continued, speaking to Phil, “remember
me to them, and you will oblige me much! If
M. Poufaille still has a picture to sell, I will buy it.
Poor M. Poufaille!” she added. “After all, he might
have succeeded, who knows? It is all such a question
of chance!”
</p>

<p>
Phil, in his heart, did not care much about seeing
Poufaille again; what sort of a welcome was there
in store for him? But he could not explain all that to
Miss Rowrer; and, besides, her desires were orders for
him—and then, he would come to Poufaille bearing
the gifts of Artaxerxes; that would calm him, no
doubt.
</p>

<p>
“I do not blush for my friends, Miss Rowrer,” Phil
said. “I will go this instant. The good fellow will be
very glad to have your order.”
</p>

<p>
“We shall see you later,” answered Ethel.
</p>

<p>
The camping-party continued its stroll through the
fair in two distinct groups. Behind were grandma and
grand’mère, talking familiarly together. The piping-time
of peace had come with currant-syrup under the
arbor by the riverside. Mme. Riçois, full of smiles, fat
and dimpling, came and went like a diplomatic valise
between the group ahead,—Ethel, Yvonne, and Will,—and
the group behind, grandma and grand’mère. These
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_324' name='Page_324' href='#Page_324'>324</a></span>
two elegant groups formed a phalanx, bannered by parasols,
in the midst of the crowd in blue blouses.
</p>

<p>
They went along the principal part of the fair, a
sort of central alley, which the circus blocked at one
end, whereas, at the other end, under dusty trees, the
show of domestic animals was lined up. From all parts
arose a continuous confusion of sounds, like the murmur
of the sea.
</p>

<p>
“What a noise!” grand’mère exclaimed. She was accustomed
to her silent house, between the deserted place
and the garden with its clipped yew-trees. “But
there’s no harm in passing by such a Jericho now and
then—it disgusts you with noise for a year to come!”
</p>

<p>
Just then Mme. Riçois came up, breathing hard.
</p>

<p>
“Oh, no! It’s too funny! I never saw Yvonne
amuse herself so much. Ah! how gay these young people
are! Do you know what M. Rowrer has been telling
us? He declares that the country, even on a fair-day
like this, soothes his nerves. Miss Rowrer is of the same
opinion; they are as merry as children.”
</p>

<p>
“Perhaps they are too merry,” grand’mère thought
to herself. “What an idea of my daughter’s to stay
at the house for her preserves, and to leave me alone
to look after Yvonne. Really, she chose her time well;
was it so necessary for Yvonne to come here and admire
the fronts of the booths? Ah! nowadays young
people never have their fill of pleasure!”
</p>

<p>
To calm her conscience, grand’mère said to herself
that it was all right for once, but that it should not
happen again. Mme. Riçois spoke the truth. They were
amusing themselves very much there in front—a great
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_325' name='Page_325' href='#Page_325'>325</a></span>
deal too much for grand’mère. Will was as gay as a boy
let loose from school.
</p>

<p>
In comparison with such a provincial fête, Chicago,
as he remembered it, made on him the effect of a machine-shop
full of the noise of steam-hammers. Taking
out his watch, he thought how at that very hour he
might have been at the Stock Exchange, worried with
business, in the midst of frenzied outcries and distorted
faces; whereas, here there were only smiles and gaiety.
Every one seemed happy, even the poorest; and the
tumult was that of good-fellowship. Joyous vine-dressers
were buying baskets for their grapes. Farther
along, waffles were frying. Here they were selling cooked
sausages; and expansive mouths were emptying their
glasses or biting into loaves of bread.
</p>

<p>
“Here are people,” Will said, “who know how to
amuse themselves.”
</p>

<p>
“Is it a secret, monsieur?” asked Yvonne.
</p>

<p>
“To be content with what one has,” answered Will.
“You have a French proverb about it: ‘<i>S’il n’y en a
pas, il n’en faut pas</i>’ [‘What you can’t have, you don’t
need’]—and that is right—don’t you think so, mademoiselle?”
</p>

<p>
“Oh, I don’t know,” said Yvonne; “you seem to
know the French people better than I.”
</p>

<p>
The rare charm of Mlle. de Grojean, her innate simplicity
and inherited refinement, seemed to Will like the
perfect expression of all he loved in France. He, who
was so taciturn, would have talked on for hours only
to see the manner, at once coquettish and reserved, with
which Yvonne listened to him.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_326' name='Page_326' href='#Page_326'>326</a></span>
</p>

<p>
“My impression of France is this,” said Will: “it
is holiday every day, and the next day you begin
again.”
</p>

<p>
“You see everything in rose-color, M. Rowrer,”
Yvonne remarked.
</p>

<p>
“No,” said Ethel, who, in her walks around the camp,
had often visited the poor—“no, it’s not all the time
holiday for everybody.”
</p>

<p>
“I know that, too,” Will replied; “life is as hard
here as anywhere else; but it is the only country where
you can give yourself the illusion that it is easy.”
</p>

<p>
They had come to the end of the central alley. Followed
by grand’mère and grandma, they had passed by
the Pretty Shepherdess of the Alps—a woman of formidable
proportions painted on canvas, in company with
three white goats, not far from the booth of the bearded
woman. Just there the group behind would have lost
the forward group, if it had not been for Mme. Riçois,
who elbowed her way with energy through the crowd,
which, at this spot, pressed together like the current
in a narrow strait. An immense lottery-wheel was turning
with a noise like the wind.
</p>

<p>
The day drew on, and the peasants were already leading
away their cattle. They went along in single file,
in front of their yoked oxen, slow as a procession. The
dust they raised settled on the trees in white powder.
</p>

<p>
“You may say what you please, Will,” Ethel continued;
“it may be all very peaceable if you compare
it with the Stock Exchange, but it’s not so compared
with Camp Rosemont.”
</p>

<p>
“We shall go to see you soon,” said Mlle. Yvonne;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_327' name='Page_327' href='#Page_327'>327</a></span>
“you know that every one is talking about it in the
town. They tell wonders of it!”
</p>

<p>
“I am sorry you cannot come to stay with us, Yvonne.
I so wish you had been there the other day. I got up an
open-air lunch for the village children; and the way
they played and laughed! We wound up everything
by dancing a great round. Sometimes autos come; and
you’d almost think you were at a gymkhana of the
Bois de Boulogne. Then I’ve begun my water-colors
again. If you would come, Yvonne, we’d make Suzanne
pose in her costume as a Pierrette.”
</p>

<p>
“<i>Ce diable!</i> That’s what grand’mère would say.
She’d never be willing!”
</p>

<p>
“But we should be with you, you know—no ugly
man—”
</p>

<p>
“With an exception for me, I hope?” Will put in.
</p>

<p>
“And if Suzanne or Helia should pose, after all, what
harm could there be?” continued Ethel. “I know very
well there are prejudices,—and don’t let’s be too severe
on them; prejudice is the counterfeit brother of good
sense; hump-backed and with horns, sometimes even
without pity. Think of Helia, who wears a more than
royal or imperial mantle—beauty! It is impossible
that so much beauty should not go along with virtue
also; and yet, no!—<i>un diable</i>, Mme. de Grojean would
say!”
</p>

<p>
“Ah!—in such a profession!” said Yvonne.
</p>

<p>
“Ah!” said Ethel; “if Helia were an actress or a
singer, she would wear crowns and recite high-sounding
verses; and the poets would give her prestige in real
life. But she has neither diamonds nor jewels; with
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_328' name='Page_328' href='#Page_328'>328</a></span>
her full complement of arms, she is only a Venus de Milo
in a silk maillot!”
</p>

<p>
“You are jesting, Ethel,” said Will. “You are not
going to compare gymnastics with dramatic art?”
</p>

<p>
“Why not? Do you know anything more beautiful
than a beautiful gesture? What comedy, what drama
can moralize us more than beauty which makes us blush
for our own ugliness, and for our poor limbs, like consumptive
chickens or stuffed turkeys! It is the training-school
of the will and of energy.”
</p>

<p>
“If she were beautiful as Venus,” Will retorted,
“I’d never choose for a wife an acrobat, offering me
her heart with a triple high leap.”
</p>

<p>
“Of course,” said Ethel, “and you would be right;
each one in his own sphere. That is one of the conditions
of happiness, and society with us has intangible
laws which only the unclassed and the <i>blasé</i> venture to
break. We do not live in the East, where slaves become
queens,—not even in Morgania, a country of icons
and superstition; in such countries anything is natural,
the only rule being the good pleasure of the master.
After all, it is one prejudice instead of another!”
</p>

<p>
Phil now came to find them. He had recognized them,
from a distance, in the crowd, by the shimmering of
their parasols. He recounted to Ethel his interview
with Poufaille. He looked delighted; everything must
have passed off well.
</p>

<p>
“There are prejudices everywhere,” Ethel went on.
“Yourself, Yvonne—do you never stand out against
prejudice? I will take Monsieur Phil for witness.”
</p>

<p>
“In what, please?” Yvonne asked.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_329' name='Page_329' href='#Page_329'>329</a></span>
</p>

<p>
“For one example, in walking with us among hundreds
of men,—those fearful men of whom you spoke
with such terror in Phil’s studio; don’t you remember?”
</p>

<p>
“Oh,” said Yvonne, looking around her indifferently,
“these good country people in their blue blouses? It
was not that I meant, Miss Ethel.”
</p>

<p>
“Then men in blue blouses are not men?” Ethel answered,
laughing. “It’s like women in maillots,—they
don’t count! What do you think, Phil?”
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_330' name='Page_330' href='#Page_330'>330</a></span>

<h3>
CHAPTER V
<br />
A BANQUET ON THE SAWDUST
</h3>

<p>
Poufaille and Phil were now friends again—really
they had been so for some time, ever since
the day when Phil had taken to Poufaille Ethel’s
order for a picture. Poufaille was incapable of nursing
wrath, and received Phil with open arms. The two <i>copains</i>
squeezed each other’s hands.
</p>

<p>
“Good old Phil!” Poufaille exclaimed; and Phil answered:
“Good old Poufaille!”
</p>

<p>
And they did not speak once of their old quarrel until
the day when the artistes had their banquet in the ring of
the circus itself.
</p>

<p>
Phil had a great deal of amusement that day. Suzanne
beggared description, and Poufaille was a show
in himself, standing up, glass in hand, and singing the
glory of the vintage. With a gesture, he snatched his
collar from his shirt.
</p>

<p>
“It chokes me! I can’t give the trills!” he said, for
the trills were the strong point of this garlic-eater and
roller of <i>r</i>’s from the South. So he thundered out his
song in honor of wine and vine, of vats and presses, and
of the good hot blood of the good old wine-drinkers.
Around the table all the voices took up the refrain, but
they could not drown the terrible voice of Poufaille,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_331' name='Page_331' href='#Page_331'>331</a></span>
which rumbled and rolled, covering all the rest as the
noise of thunder covers the twittering of sparrows.
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="o1">“Buveurs de vin—couchez dans la poussière</p>
<p class="i5">Ces buveurs de bière!”</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="o2">(“Wine drinkers, throw down in the dust</p>
<p class="i5">All drinkers of beer!”)</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>
Scornful laughter shook his sides, and he struggled
to give his good-natured voice a diabolical, biting tone,
as he repeated, looking at Phil:
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p>“Ces buveurs de bière!”</p>
</div></div>

<p>
Poufaille, excited by the wine, had a look of fury.
But when he had finished, his shaggy eyebrows grew
peaceful, and a smile spread all at once over his big,
good-natured face.
</p>

<p>
“You’re not angry at me, I hope?” he said to Phil,
patting him on the shoulder. “What I said about beer-drinkers
does not vex you—<i>hein</i>?”
</p>

<p>
“It doesn’t touch me,” answered Phil, “for I only
drink water!”
</p>

<p>
“True, so you do, poor fellow!” Poufaille said in a
tone of pity. “Good old Phil!”
</p>

<p>
“Good old Poufaille,” Phil replied, “sing whatever
you wish; we sha’n’t quarrel for that!”
</p>

<p>
Poufaille was reassured, filled up his glass, and emptied
it at a draught.
</p>

<p>
“Look out,” said Phil, “you’ll drink too much.”
</p>

<p>
“Let me be; I need it,” Poufaille answered; and it
was almost with a gesture of despair that he filled his
glass again. Those around them, also, were not drinking
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_332' name='Page_332' href='#Page_332'>332</a></span>
water. Phil had done things on a large scale. He
had ordered champagne—as much champagne as they
wished. A full glass was offered to Poufaille, but he
refused it.
</p>

<p>
“Champagne? <i>Pouah!</i> That is a wine for foreigners!”
he explained. “Give me good old red wine—and
let me drink till my thirst is quenched!”
</p>

<p>
On the table—or rather on the jumping-board of the
circus, which stood on props with its chalk-powder giving
the illusion of a white cloth—there was a mass of
dishes and plates and empty bottles. It had been spread
in the very middle of the ring—in the good odor of sawdust.
Around the table, seated on the chairs of equilibrists,
or on the stools of hand-balancers, were the circus
artistes and a few invited guests. They had laughed a
great deal during the banquet, before the time came for
the songs and toasts.
</p>

<p>
“We all look as if we had the plague!” Suzanne
said, by way of appetizer, pointing to the color of the
faces under the green reflected light of the tent. Thereupon
Poufaille grew livid, in his constant terror of the
most imaginary ailments—stoppage of the blood, wind,
stiff neck, plague, and cholera.
</p>

<p>
“Shut off the draughts of air!” he cried, “we’ll all
get our death!”
</p>

<p>
He all but fainted with fear as he saw, in front of
him, his plate rising up in the air without his touching
it.
</p>

<p>
“My plate! my plate is going away!” he stammered,
in terror.
</p>

<p class="caption">The Banquet in the Ring of the Circus</p>
</div>

<p>
“Oh! what is the matter?” Suzanne cried. “I can’t
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_333' name='Page_333' href='#Page_333'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_334' name='Page_334' href='#Page_334'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_335' name='Page_335' href='#Page_335'>335</a></span>
understand it—perhaps a snake has got loose from the
menagerie next door!”
</p>

<p>
“Help! Help!” Poufaille sputtered, ready to faint.
</p>

<p>
“What are you afraid of?” said Perbaccho, the master
of the show. “Don’t you see that it is only Suzanne
playing tricks on you?”
</p>

<p>
“Oh, it’s all right, then!” Poufaille said, recovering
his assurance. “She’s been playing me all sorts of
tricks lately—not counting the strokes of the broomstick!”
</p>

<p>
In fact, Suzanne had brought out her whole repertory
of practical jokes—liquids that flame up, powder which,
thrown into a ragout, crawls about in the shape of a
worm, pasteboard mice that run across the table, papier-mâché
fruits and cheeses, and paste sweetmeats. The
lunch was one long burst of laughter.
</p>

<p>
When the dessert came Perbaccho, the master, arose,
glass in hand.
</p>

<p>
“To the health of Monsieur Phil!” he said.
</p>

<p>
“Here’s to his health!” repeated the guests around
the jumping-board.
</p>

<p>
“Vive Monsieur Phil!” said the children, who were sitting
farther on, at a little table with spangled velvet
fringe, on which, during his performances, the juggler
placed his balls and knives. Sœurette was there; Helia
had brought her, although she was too great an artiste
to show herself at Perbaccho’s circus. She had come to
the country to be near Suzanne and to rest.
</p>

<p>
“Dear friends,” Perbaccho went on, in the same voice
with which he announced his Grrrand Representations,
“the time has come to thank Monsieur Phil for the great
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_336' name='Page_336' href='#Page_336'>336</a></span>
and numerous services which he has rendered us. [Applause.]
Now that Monsieur Phil is going to leave us, we
do not wish to let him depart without saying to him—hum,
hum—how grateful we are for his having been willing
to put his talents at our disposition. [“Bravo!”]
Hum, hum—although Monsieur Phil has not yet set up
for himself in the fairs, nevertheless he is a real artiste;
and the delighted public looks with great pleasure—I
will even say with enchantment—at the portrait which
decorates our platform and represents Mademoiselle Suzanne
of the O’Poufaille Family!”
</p>

<p>
“Vive la joie!” Suzanne began.
</p>

<p>
“Hear! hear!”
</p>

<p>
“Also Monsieur Poufaille’s portrait in his exercises of
strength.”
</p>

<p>
“Bravo!” cried Poufaille, squeezing Phil’s hand hard
enough to crush it.
</p>

<p>
“Mesdames et messieurs,” Perbaccho continued, “my
modest establishment does not permit me to offer Phil,
the artiste, that salary to which he has a right to pretend;
but let not that prevent us from drinking his
health. Come now, mesdames et messieurs, here’s to the
health of Monsieur Phil!”
</p>

<p>
It was not a thing which had to be repeated; every
one drank to Phil’s health; and Phil returned thanks.
</p>

<p>
Phil enjoyed the popularity he had won by his friendliness
to such good people. It was true—to please
Suzanne, he had done her portrait with a few hours’
work. Yet Suzanne did not welcome him, as she had
done in the old times, with a “Good day, Phil! Roll
me a cigarette, <i>mon petit</i>!” Even her monkeyshines
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_337' name='Page_337' href='#Page_337'>337</a></span>
ceased in his presence; this was something he did not
understand. He had also painted Poufaille as a Hercules,
lifting enormous weights. Moreover, he had rendered
light services to all this little world of the fair.
He had his recompense. He had entered most intimately
into the life of the little world. His album had been enriched
by any number of sketches and types, by picturesque
interiors as somber and stirring with life as those
of Rembrandt. He had daring foreshortenings of gymnasts
at the trapeze, of handsome boys and pretty girls
with muscles like antique statues.
</p>

<p>
Every one admired the strength and address with
which a simple amateur like Phil handled the dumb-bells
or climbed the smooth rope. They were only astonished
that, with a talent like his, he did not open a
place for himself to do portraits at four or five francs
apiece—that would bring him in a good day’s earnings;
and this would not include the pupils who would be with
him from time to time—they had seen some of them at
the fair with him. He might open a permanent Beauty
Exhibition; there was that big blonde, especially—but
they never spoke to him about that. They were completely
ignorant of whom he was or whom his friends
were. Suzanne, flighty as she was, was discretion itself
on this point, and there was no danger of Poufaille talking
when Suzanne forbade him. No one suspected that
the big blonde was rich enough to buy up the circus and
its artistes with it, and Signor Perbaccho to boot, as well
as all the side-shows and the whole fair, and the houses
round about the fair. They did not even know her
name. As to Phil, when they met him in the circus-tent,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_338' name='Page_338' href='#Page_338'>338</a></span>
or with the wrestlers, making his sketches, they
treated him like any other comrade.
</p>

<p>
The Rowrers’ yacht was to sail for Morgania in a few
days, taking away the whole party, after two months
at Camp Rosemont. Before his departure Phil wished
to give pleasure to Poufaille and his friends by this
luncheon with him. They yielded to his insistence, and
accepted without ceremony. It gave him little trouble,
and he brought his box and canvas to finish a study
near by in the fields. This was a present he wished to
offer to Ethel, and it reminded him of the pastimes of
other days.
</p>

<p>
On the morrow, during the hunt—on the morrow,
he had promised, he had sworn it to himself, and the
moment was drawing near—no power in the world could
hinder him—and yet how anxious he was! He was already
in a fever and occupied himself with this lunch
only to distract his thoughts, to prove to himself that
he was calm and reasonable, that he had not lost his
head. He looked at the groups around the jumping-board
which had been turned into a table, and thought
of the morrow. He surprised himself repeating in a
low tone: “To-morrow!”
</p>

<p>
“What are you giving us with your ‘To-morrow’?”
asked Poufaille, who overheard it. “Perhaps to-morrow
others and not we shall be drinking the wine. I know
no to-morrow but to-day! I tell you it’s drinking water
that makes you sad and dreamy.”
</p>

<p>
“And you—is it wine that makes you so gay?” Phil
retorted.
</p>

<p>
“Well, I have little reason to be gay,” Poufaille replied.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_339' name='Page_339' href='#Page_339'>339</a></span>
“If I drink, it is to stun myself. See here, do
you want me to tell you?—but what use would it be!
He who lives will see. By the way, you know that
Helia has come back with Sœurette. She’s in town for
a few days.”
</p>

<p>
“What!” Phil exclaimed; “how is it she is not here?”
</p>

<p>
“She was tired,” replied Poufaille. “But, <i>entre nous</i>,
Phil, you’d just as lief she shouldn’t be here—eh?”
</p>

<p>
“But why?” Phil asked.
</p>

<p>
Poufaille was on the point of speaking, but some one
at the end of the table called out with all his might:
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">“Farine! farine!</p>
<p>Embrassez votre voisine!”</p>
</div></div>

<p class="post">
It was the gallant refrain which winds up rustic feasts.
Around the board all the women lent themselves with
good grace to the custom. Poufaille devoured Suzanne
with his eyes.
</p>

<p>
“Here’s your time,” Phil said to him. “What are
you waiting for? Kiss her now, kiss her; she owes you
as much as that!”
</p>

<p>
“Kiss her?” Poufaille said, looking at Phil gloomily.
“Are you making fun of me? She hasn’t let me kiss
her for more than a month; she’s furious against every
one—against myself!”
</p>

<p>
“Oh, now!” said Phil, “Suzanne furious? She
wouldn’t be so gay.”
</p>

<p>
“I tell you she is; and I can see it. Do you think it
gives me pleasure to take the blows of a broomstick on
my head? The stick is light, it is true, and I have a
false pigskin skull; but never mind! is that a trade?
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_340' name='Page_340' href='#Page_340'>340</a></span>
You knew me and you knew her. I was the creator of
‘Liberty’ and ‘Fraternity’; and now you see what I am—a
fly-killer! It’s flattering, <i>hein</i>? To be a fly-killer
when I feel within myself the soul of a lion!”
</p>

<p>
“Keep up your hopes,” Phil answered; “all that will
change.”
</p>

<p>
“‘Keep up your hopes’! But you know nothing
about it,” Poufaille hurried on with his tragic voice;
“oh, Suzanne strikes hard with her <i>aïe donc</i>! But the
hardest is that I should pay up for others. Oh, yes; I receive
blows which ought to have been for you!”
</p>

<p>
“For me?” Phil gasped.
</p>

<p>
“Yes, for you—which ought to have been for you—for
you—you hear?” and Poufaille shook Phil by the
coat collar. “I tell you, it’s your fault!”
</p>

<p>
“You must be crazy,” Phil answered. “What have
I done?”
</p>

<p>
“What have you done?” Poufaille continued, in the
excitement of his glass of rum. “Do you want to know
what you have done? I am going to tell you what you
have done—to me! You have stolen my share of happiness!”
</p>

<p>
“Has that taken hold of you again?” said Phil. “I
thought it was over—all this nonsense about stealing
glory.”
</p>

<p>
“It isn’t glory, I tell you! It’s happiness!”
</p>

<p>
Phil and Poufaille were speaking low, and no one
heard them. Suzanne had sat down, and every one was
accustomed to Poufaille’s gestures. No one paid any
attention.
</p>

<p>
“Good Poufaille, dear old Poufaille, I am sorry to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_341' name='Page_341' href='#Page_341'>341</a></span>
give you pain, old man,” Phil said pleasantly, as he
took away the bottle.
</p>

<p>
“No; it’s not worth while,” Poufaille said sadly;
“I shall drink no more. Only follow what I say,—do
you follow? Do you know why I am not married?”
</p>

<p>
“No,” said Phil, putting the bottle beyond reach.
</p>

<p>
“It is because <i>you</i> are not married.”
</p>

<p>
“Indeed!” said Phil. “So, my good Poufaille, you
wish to marry me off like that?”
</p>

<p>
“Yes; as you swore you would do!” answered Poufaille.
</p>

<p>
“To whom?”
</p>

<p>
“To Helia!”
</p>

<p>
“Speak lower!” Phil said, disquieted.
</p>

<p>
But even if they had talked louder, no one would have
caught a word. Conversation was general around the
board. The kissing was finished, and they were smoking
cigarettes. The men talked horses, balancing, feats
of strength; the ladies talked dress, spangled maillots,
gauze skirts.
</p>

<p>
Phil and Poufaille, at their end of the table, were
as free to converse as if they had been alone. Poufaille
now bent over Phil, as if to tell him a secret.
</p>

<p>
“Yes; you swore it!” he continued. “And Suzanne
concludes from it that the best of men are worth nothing
at all—that men are windmills for lying. When I tell
her I love her, that I’ll make her happy—when I swear
to her that I cannot live without her, she turns on
her heel, saying: ‘That’s all humbug!’ and that she
can trust no one, not me more than you; that it costs
nothing to get down on one’s knees; that our promises
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_342' name='Page_342' href='#Page_342'>342</a></span>
and oaths ought to be stuffed down our throats; and that
the way you treated Helia was a shame—”
</p>

<p>
“Speak lower!” said Phil.
</p>

<p>
“—that you had promised her marriage,” Poufaille
kept on; “that you loved her madly; that if need had
been you would have taken God to witness; that you had
sworn to her she should be your wife, and that you could
not live without her. And, besides, it was no sudden
stroke—you had known her for years, you had long
loved her. And all at once, without any one knowing
why, just because you earn a little money and have
talent, while she is only a poor acrobat,—suddenly, without
reason, you know her no longer; and if you should
meet her in the street, you would turn your head.
That’s what Suzanne says; and she has more head than
all of us—and more heart, too!”
</p>

<p>
Poufaille looked toward Suzanne with a sigh. Then
he went on again: “Oh, Phil, I should never have told
you all this; but, <i>ma foi</i>, it was choking me! I’m not
one of your Northern folks, to keep a secret. To me it’s
like a starched collar—I must pull it off! Now give me
a glass of wine!”
</p>

<p>
Phil hesitated.
</p>

<p>
“Pour it out, I tell you,” Poufaille insisted. “I
have a fever. It calms me; and, after all, there’s truth
in wine!”
</p>

<p>
Phil poured out a full glass, which Poufaille emptied.
</p>

<p>
“Ah, yes, yes!” he went on again, wanderingly, as he
put his glass down on the table; “when I think that
without these stories she would have been my wife—and
now she will not be, for when she says No, it means no!
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_343' name='Page_343' href='#Page_343'>343</a></span>
She may be gay to look at, but she’s sad at heart. She
has heaps of ideas that turn my blood. On my honor,
I believe she will end in a convent! What! Phil, I
laugh also; but I have no desire to laugh. It’s only by
habit, you know; I feel more like weeping. And as to
all those stories about glory which bothered me, how
stupid one is to curdle one’s blood for so little! But
my happiness is gone forever; I shall never marry Suzanne,
never, never!”
</p>

<p>
Poufaille’s gestures emphasized his words; his fist
came down heavily upon the table.
</p>

<p>
“Eh, over there! don’t break anything,” Suzanne
cried. “Poufaille, you’re losing your head!”
</p>

<p>
“Yes, I’m losing it—I mean no!” answered Poufaille.
“I’m only telling a story.”
</p>

<p>
“That’s no reason for getting into a rage,” Suzanne
answered pleasantly.
</p>

<p>
“Yes, it is a reason,” Poufaille murmured. “There
is reason to get into a rage—and break things!”
</p>

<p>
“Calm yourself; be quiet,” said Phil, who now regretted
that he had come.
</p>

<p>
“Bah!” he thought; “is it worth my while listening
to drunken maunderings?” But the hour for breaking
up was near.
</p>

<p>
Phil stayed on, however, and Poufaille kept on talking.
</p>

<p>
“Ah!” he said, crossing his arms and looking Phil
in the face; “after all, why didn’t you marry her?
Yes, why? You loved Helia, and no one can say anything
against her. You agree with me about that, I
suppose?”
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_344' name='Page_344' href='#Page_344'>344</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Phil did not answer.
</p>

<p>
“Dear old Phil,” Poufaille insisted strongly, “you
can’t deny it? We shouldn’t be friends otherwise, you
know.”
</p>

<p>
“I alone must be judge of that,” Phil said.
</p>

<p>
“No!” Poufaille said; “that’s your new way of looking
at things; but I tell you, there’s not a woman in
the world above her—do you understand?—not one! I
tell you—not one!”
</p>

<p>
Phil frowned.
</p>

<p>
“I’m not making any allusions,” said Poufaille.
</p>

<p>
“I should hope not,” said Phil.
</p>

<p>
“I am only telling you the truth,” Poufaille declared;
“and I am glad to have said it. I can breathe better
now. It’s true! It turned my blood to hear Suzanne
telling it, with Helia so sad. When I think that you
used to be so rigid about such things—and now you
act just like the others! What’s the difference between
you and Socrate? For a man who is always quoting
the Bible and setting himself up as an example—you’re
a bad one, that’s all!”
</p>

<p>
Phil turned pale.
</p>

<p>
“Poufaille is drunk,” he thought. “I’d best go
away.”
</p>

<p>
But he stayed on; and Poufaille kept on talking; and
Phil listened, in spite of himself, unmoved to all appearance,
but deeply touched at bottom, for he could not
say to Poufaille: “You are lying! It is false! I promised
nothing!”
</p>

<p>
“Yes,” Poufaille continued, in a low voice, making
sure that no one was listening—“yes, I know what you
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_345' name='Page_345' href='#Page_345'>345</a></span>
might say: Helia’s surroundings, Socrate,—I know not
what. You have suspected her, that I do know! Suzanne
has told me. Our good Helia, who would give
her life for you—if she only gives money to a beggar
you suspect her for it; for Socrate is a beggar—a beggar
she keeps alive out of pure charity, just as she helps
Cemetery, simply because he is old and cannot work.
But you know that as well as I.”
</p>

<p>
“But the duke,” Phil spoke up. “I saw Helia—”
</p>

<p>
“You saw Suzanne! Ah, I’ve blamed Suzanne often
enough for it since—what an idea in her to go to take
supper with the duke! I’d rather she would strike me
with the broomstick!”
</p>

<p>
“And yet,” Phil began.
</p>

<p>
“It’s true the duke was greatly taken with her,”
Poufaille continued; “she had only a word to say and
he would have offered her anything. She never accepted
a thing—not even a flower!”
</p>

<p>
“Ah!” said Phil.
</p>

<p>
“You see,” Poufaille went on, “you don’t care much
to meet Helia—you have your own reasons for it—for
she is here, you know!”
</p>

<p>
Phil raised his head, as if he expected to see the canvas
of the circus-tent open and Helia appear there looking
at him. But there was no one save the artistes rising
from the table and taking away the things. They were
even removing the board, so as to leave the ring free.
In the stables they were preparing the horses for rehearsal.
He could hear the harness rattling, and the
whips snapping. The ring, which had been so gay,
suddenly became gloomy. Phil frankly regretted that
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_346' name='Page_346' href='#Page_346'>346</a></span>
he had come. He had a single thought,—how to get
away. Taking up his color-box and canvas, he said
good day to every one, and shook Poufaille’s hand.
</p>

<p>
“You’re going away?” Poufaille said. “You haven’t
a grudge against me, I hope—it was too much for me!”
</p>

<p>
“I have nothing against you, old Poufaille.”
</p>

<p>
“Shall we see you again soon?”
</p>

<p>
“Who knows!” answered Phil; adding within himself:
“Perhaps never!”
</p>

<p>
As he went out he cast a farewell look on the empty
benches, on the white ladder and great globe, on the
saddles and the maillots which were drying, and on the
clowns’ costumes. They were like old acquaintances
whom he should see no more.

<h3>
CHAPTER VI
<br />
WAS POUFAILLE RIGHT?
</h3>

<p>
Once outside, Phil breathed easier. It seemed to
him that the open air was driving away his
nightmare, as the sun drives the darkness before
it.
</p>

<p>
“Poufaille is either crazy or drunk,” he said to himself,
as he went through the fair with his paint-box in
his hand. “Suzanne won’t have him! I have nothing
to do with it! Is that a reason to take tragically a childish
love-making? And why should Suzanne interfere?
Helia has never even breathed a word of it to me, and
I’ve seen her often enough since. Surely, love must be
muddling Poufaille’s brain, if it is not the blows of
the broomstick. He forgets that I am no longer the
little boy to whom Suzanne was a great actress, Poufaille
a great sculptor, Caracal a great psychologist, and
Socrate a painter-poet-thinker-philosopher! There’s
been a change since then—and I alone am judge of it.”
</p>

<p>
Phil acknowledged to himself that he had been a little
troubled. Poufaille, with all his simplicity, was candor
itself, and incapable of lying. Yes,—Phil repeated
it over as if it gave him relief: Poufaille was drunk;
the least beer-drinker would see ten wine-drinkers like
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_348' name='Page_348' href='#Page_348'>348</a></span>
that under the table! He did Poufaille too much honor
by listening to him; and Suzanne was a scatterbrain.
Leave Suzanne her salad, and Poufaille his pig’s-rump
and garlic and wine! Leave every one to his own trade,
and let them stop minding his affairs! Think of it!
Now that he was a man, just when he had fallen in
love with a young girl whom no one could approach,
unless with a pure conscience—it was now that Poufaille
would bring him down to the ground, reproaching him
with having proved false to an oath,—with having been
cowardly and mean, as if he had taken up with Helia to
amuse himself with her and then cast her away! Poufaille,
stupid and drunken, had said as much!
</p>

<p>
The absurdity of the idea, even more than the open
air and gay sunlight, drove from his memory the sculptor’s
idle tales.
</p>

<p>
Phil hastened his steps, for he wished to finish the
little picture which he had in his box. It was a nook of
the landscape out beyond the last scattering houses of
the town—a charming spot which they had discovered
one day in the automobile. It was a place which had
greatly pleased Miss Ethel.
</p>

<p>
She had said: “There are spots which you see for
the first time, and yet they impress you like old friends.
Would it not be delightful to have a little cottage here,
and take care of one’s own flowers. But no! one must
have autos and horses—Longchamps and Epsom and
Haymarket—ah! what fools these mortals be!”
</p>

<p>
The snorting forty-horse-power machine bore them
afar while she was still building her little cottage.
</p>

<p>
“If I were a painter,” she added, “that is what I
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_349' name='Page_349' href='#Page_349'>349</a></span>
would paint. With the simplest subject you can make
a masterpiece. This nook has pleased me, and I shall
come back to it, be sure!”
</p>

<p>
Phil said nothing at the time; but he determined to
paint the nook which had pleased Ethel so much, and
to give the picture to her as a surprise before they left
for Morgania.
</p>

<p>
Phil passed through the parts of the town which
were between the open country and the fair. They were
like the outskirts of other towns, with little boxes of
houses and grimy wine-shops, and with great bare
spaces where goats, the cows of the poor man, bleated
despairingly. Just beyond was the full, open country.
He approached the spot chosen by Miss Ethel. The
noise of the town was no longer heard; before him were
the gently rising hills crossed by flowering hedges and
great leafy groves, in which the birds were playing.
</p>

<p>
Phil set up his easel in a shady spot, where Ethel
had lingered. It was by a hedge above a slope leading
down to a footpath. He opened his box, prepared
his colors, and set to work. At times he leaned back to
judge better the effect of the whole picture. At times
he bent over to put in a touch; and as he painted, he let
his mind wander as it would.
</p>

<p>
He could not help thinking of the morrow—of the
<i>chasse à courre</i>, the mounted deer-hunt with dogs, with
which the Comtesse de Donjeon was honoring the
camping-party. It seemed to him that he was already
there, taking in all its details. Even his costume occupied
his mind—the Chantilly boots, the full white
breeches, the double-breasted coat, the high felt hat—the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_350' name='Page_350' href='#Page_350'>350</a></span>
things which constitute the true huntsman’s costume.
It would become him well; and how charming
she would be, with her blond hair under the three-cornered
marquise hat!
</p>

<p>
Phil already fancied himself hearing the joyful notes
of the hunting-horn, and watching the unrestrained
galloping beneath the great trees,—a vision of the
Middle Ages, with plumed knights and gentle ladies on
their palfreys. Oh! there was one gentle lady who
would follow the hunt with him,—and, lover as he was,
Phil thought there would be monstrous daring in his
wish to offer Miss Rowrer a nosegay of wild flowers,—for
certainly she would see his trouble of soul, and he
would betray himself as he offered it. Miss Rowrer
could not be offended, of course! she had been too
much courted in society not to allow a little of it in
the country. It was the business of bores in society
life; but supposing she saw what he meant, would she
deign to encourage him?
</p>

<p class="caption">Phil Watching Helia and Socrate</p>
</div>

<p>
All this preoccupied Phil, as he put the finishing
touches to his landscape. The place inclined to reverie.
While he was there, scarcely two or three persons had
passed along the road below. They could not see him;
it would be necessary to climb up the slope and break
through the hawthorn hedge. For two hours Phil had
been working. He had reached the time, so dangerous
for the artist, when a few strokes too much spoil the
picture. He resolved to leave it as it was, without any
working up, in all its freshness of first inspiration. He
was preparing to close his box and fold his easel before
going back to Camp Rosemont; but two persons appeared
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_351' name='Page_351' href='#Page_351'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_352' name='Page_352' href='#Page_352'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_353' name='Page_353' href='#Page_353'>353</a></span>
in the lane below. He gave them no more attention
than he had given to others. It seemed to him
that a man was speaking, and a woman replying. He
did not see them; but when they came near him he recognized
their voices.
</p>

<p>
He stopped motionless and listened again, thinking
he must have been mistaken. He leaned over and
looked through the branches of the hedge. It was indeed
they—Helia and Socrate.
</p>

<p>
Phil felt a chill at his heart. He would like to
have had Poufaille there for a moment—only for a
moment—yet no! he would be the only witness! He
would see falling away before him, dropping to the
dust, petal by petal, the flower of his childish love. He
was going to hear Helia talking sweetly, arm in arm,
with the painter-thinker. His little Saint John of other
days, so pure and simple, he would hear her; but, ah,
how he wished that he was not there, that he could not
hear!
</p>

<p>
But he heard everything. Bits of conversation
mounted up to him as if torn asunder by the thorns
of the hedge.
</p>

<p>
“Listen to me!” Socrate was saying.
</p>

<p>
“I know what you are going to say,” answered Helia.
“Begone!—I have told you—no!”
</p>

<p>
“Yet you were so good to me,” continued the tearful
voice of Socrate, using the familiar “thou.”
</p>

<p>
“Socrate, I tell you once again, you are to say ‘you’
when you speak to me,” Helia interrupted firmly.
“Any one listening to you might think you had rights
over me!”
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_354' name='Page_354' href='#Page_354'>354</a></span>
</p>

<p>
“But no one is listening!”
</p>

<p>
“I hear you!”
</p>

<p>
There was a moment of silence. They had stopped
and Phil looked at them. He was astounded by the
change in Socrate. His beard was unkempt, and he
lowered his head with an air at once humble and aggressive.
He spoke to Helia with looks which he tried
to render touching. On his ragged garments were bits
of straw, as if he had slept in a stack. It was clear
that Socrate had been wandering around the neighborhood
for several days, waiting for Helia. He must
have met her by chance and, yielding to his entreaties,
she had followed him to have, alone with him, a final
explanation.
</p>

<p>
Helia was pale, tired from her journey, as Poufaille
had said. Her black eyes shone feverishly. In her
modest black gown she seemed to Phil more beautiful
than ever, and more refined. She scarcely turned her
head toward Socrate; and her glance at him was that of
scornful pity.
</p>

<p>
“You who were so good to me,” the tearful voice
went on.
</p>

<p>
“Too good, it is true!” answered Helia. “I saw your
wretchedness,—that you were starving,—and I believed
in your genius. I would have been proud to help a
poet,—to have had something to do, no matter how little,
with the production of a masterpiece. I sinned by
pride; I thought I could lift myself in the eyes of others—especially
in <i>his</i> eyes,” she added slowly. “I thought
I was acting for the best; I was wrong!”
</p>

<p>
“Why were you wrong?”
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_355' name='Page_355' href='#Page_355'>355</a></span>
</p>

<p>
“It is wrong to aid one who does nothing!”
</p>

<p>
“Ah!” replied the man, with his look of a beaten
dog, “it is not my fault if I have not fulfilled my
dream. Society is pitiless to thinkers! Those who
march to a lofty goal are disdained by the common
herd!”
</p>

<p>
Socrate, as he spoke, clenched his fist. Phil could
see his fingers working spasmodically—ah! if he could
only strangle the whole world! Helia did not let her
eyes fall so low. She fixed them on the face of Socrate,
scorning his impotent gestures.
</p>

<p>
“Silence! You are only grotesque!”
</p>

<p>
“Be it so, I have made a mistake,” the voice went
on. “But I can make amends for my wrong-doing.
Ah! if you only were willing—if you were willing, I
could make you happy. I would occupy myself with
your affairs; you should be rid of every care. You
would have a sure friend, and I, too,—I would become
an artiste!”
</p>

<p>
“You—an artiste!”
</p>

<p>
She drew herself up to her full height and looked
at the great empty forehead, at the chicken-necked and
round-shouldered Socrate, at his sallow skin, his moral
hideousness, this rag of a painter and poet and thinker
and philosopher.
</p>

<p>
“An artiste—you! Why, you would not be capable
even to show a shaved bear, or a sick dog, or a two-headed
calf! Oh, I know you! You’d like to be a
professor and train Sœurette with strokes of the whip,
if you were allowed! And you’d always be there at
my side, to steer me through life like a devoted friend,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_356' name='Page_356' href='#Page_356'>356</a></span>
would you? Just as you used to do before. And when
I think that people may have said as much, and perhaps
believed that I was your—friend,—and when I
remember that you advised me to frequent the company
of a rich duke and forget the friend of my childhood,—when
I think of all that, it is enough to make
me die of shame!”
</p>

<p>
Socrate gnashed his teeth.
</p>

<p>
“So it’s the friend of your childhood, is it?—always
he?”
</p>

<p>
“Always he!” said Helia, simply.
</p>

<p>
“Yet you know—I have told you—that he loves another.”
</p>

<p>
“I know it.”
</p>

<p>
“And that he no longer cares for you.”
</p>

<p>
“I shall believe it when he tells me so himself,” was
Helia’s answer.
</p>

<p>
Socrate put his hands to his head, as if to say: “Can
one be such a fool!”
</p>

<p>
“But, really,” he said aloud, “since you love him
so much, why do you not use the weapons you have to
bring him back to you?”
</p>

<p>
“Weapons!”
</p>

<p>
“His letters!”
</p>

<p>
“You are a miserable fellow! See—here are his letters!”
And Helia took from her breast a few yellowed
envelopes. “They might, indeed, fall into the hands
of a wretch like you.” And opening them, she tore
the pages in small pieces.
</p>

<p>
“But there’s a fortune in them for you!” gasped
Socrate. “You don’t know what you are doing!”
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_357' name='Page_357' href='#Page_357'>357</a></span>
</p>

<p>
“There’s what I care for such a fortune!” said
Helia; and she opened wide her hand. It might have
been a flight of white butterflies. The light breeze
scattered the fragments on every side. Some seemed
to hesitate, as if issuing from a warm nest, and then
mounted upward, whirling around in space. Others
fell on the hedge. All these poor little things which
had been promises of love, and held in themselves an
entire youth, were scattered at once by a breath from
heaven.
</p>

<p>
“Yet I loved them well,” she said. “Only it is better
so.”
</p>

<p>
Then, speaking to Socrate, she added proudly: “I
will not have him love me for fear,—I wish him to love
me for love’s sake!”
</p>

<p>
Blushing for shame, she turned her back to Socrate,
and walked away without a look behind. The man
began following her. She turned back a last time,
stopped him with an imperious gesture, and disappeared
in the lane.
</p>

<p>
Socrate, in his fury, growled like a wolf. Phil saw
him turn his head rapidly, to make sure there was
no one near, and then put his hand quickly to his
pocket, as if to take out a knife. But no doubt what
he sought was not there; and his hand came forth
empty—luckily for Socrate, since Phil would have leaped
the hedge with a bound and fallen on him like a thunderbolt.
Then Socrate disappeared among the trees with
a furtive look.
</p>

<p>
Phil remained alone. He put everything in order,
folding his things together, and went away. He felt
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_358' name='Page_358' href='#Page_358'>358</a></span>
a sort of embarrassment—a shame that made him
hurry his footsteps as if to flee from himself.
</p>

<p>
Was Poufaille right? Phil passed his hand across
his forehead. A thousand things came back to him
now; a bright light was thrown on the abyss where his
youth had perished. The flight of the white butterflies
had been a seed of remembrance to him—the remembrance
of the love of his boyhood. Had it been the
romantic passion of an ignorant heart? No; there had
been broken promises and contempt of oaths!
</p>

<p>
Well, even in such a case, drunken Poufaille had exaggerated;
Helia was more reasonable. She must understand
that it was impossible. She could not deceive
herself to such a degree, nor keep on pursuing imaginations
never to be realized. Her own words, “I
shall believe it when he tells me so himself,” were a confession.
She would submit to the inevitable. How
was she going to take the final rupture? Phil, in his
heart, trembled to think of it, but it had to be! He
would tell her everything; he would take back the word
he had given. He would speak to her, lowering his eyes,
hunting for his words; low, as when one begs for forgiveness.
Never mind, he would tell her! He would act
as with a somnambulist, commanding: “Awake! it was a
dream!”
</p>

<p>
Yes; Helia would understand, without need of insisting.
They would part with a loyal shake of the hand,
like the good friends they were, and would follow separate
destinies.
</p>

<p>
Phil walked on, without looking behind, like one escaping.
He felt easier in his mind. No, there was not
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_359' name='Page_359' href='#Page_359'>359</a></span>
such a tragedy in it all as Poufaille had led him to
foresee. Things would go on simply, Phil mused within
himself. For him it was the time of slanting sophisms
which issue from the folds of the heart like crabs from
under a rock. He was more sincere and manly when he
put aside with a gesture all his anguish and uncertainty
and, setting his jaw, lifted his head as he said to himself:
“It is too late! Fate has willed it; all society
would be on my side; they would say I was right. Even
if Helia’s tears should flow, even if I should see in her
eyes a mute malediction for the slayer of her illusions,
I could do no otherwise; it is too late!”
</p>

<p>
Phil breathed deeply, as if his breast had been lightened
of a heavy load. He looked around him with the
air of a man to whom the future belongs.
</p>

<p>
Lowering his eyes, he saw upon his shoulder one of
the poor little fragments of torn letters. Phil threw
it from him with a snap of his finger.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_360' name='Page_360' href='#Page_360'>360</a></span>

<h3>
CHAPTER VII
<br />
“A TRUE HEART LOVES BUT ONCE”
</h3>

<p>
The day for which Phil had waited so impatiently
was come at last—the day of the <i>chasse à courre</i>.
Ethel left the hunt and came back alone to the
glade where grandma, a little tired and seated in the
great break, was waiting for the return of the hunters.
She got down from her horse and tossed the reins to a
valet. The sun lighted up the tops of the lofty trees,
leaving all the rest in the shade. From afar they heard
the voices of the hounds. The hunting-horn filled the
forest with a far-away melody.
</p>

<p>
“Poor little doe!” said Ethel, “it is nearly an hour
since she left the thicket, followed by the hounds. She
must be by this time in the pretty valley I christened
the other day the Forest of Arden—you remember?—when
I was reading there Shakspere’s ‘As You
Like It.’ They must have lost the scent—her mate
is leading the dogs away from her, no doubt. But it
is not for that I have come back, grandma. I wish to
speak with you.”
</p>

<p>
“Why don’t you follow the hunt?” grandma asked.
“Has anything happened to you, Ethel?”
</p>

<p>
“Nothing at all, grandma. My horse was in splendid
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_361' name='Page_361' href='#Page_361'>361</a></span>
form, and I, too; but, while taking a ditch, she lost a
shoe. She’s limping a little, I think. And then—and
then I couldn’t see you alone yesterday at the
château, and I have something to say to you. But let us
not stay here; they might overhear us,” Ethel added,
glancing at the lackeys, who were loading into a
van the champagne-baskets and other remains of the
picnic.
</p>

<p>
“I will get down,” said grandma. Leaning on
Ethel’s arm, she got out of the break and they crossed
the open space.
</p>

<p>
“Let us go over there,” Ethel said, pointing to one
of those graceful edifices called <i>nymphées</i>, which are
the necessary ornament of every self-respecting park.
It consisted of a bench, green with the mold of time
and surrounded by a colonnade covered with moss and
ivy. It gave this corner of the forest a mythological
note. It was like one of those rustic shrines where, in
the shadow of the sacred grove, goddesses were appeased
by the offering of victims.
</p>

<p>
“Who would not say this is a scene of Shakspere’s
fancy?” said Ethel. “Listen to the hunting-horn—you
might believe you were in an enchanted forest.
But,” she added, as grandma sat down, “there is no
question now of Will the Great, but only of our own
dear Will, and of Mlle. Yvonne.”
</p>

<p>
“She’s very nice,” said grandma. “She’ll profit
a great deal by your company, between Will and you.
From being a doll, Yvonne will soon become a woman.”
</p>

<p>
“Mlle. Yvonne is already a woman—a true one,”
Ethel went on, gravely. “She has an upright mind
and a strong and resolute heart; and I love her.”
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_362' name='Page_362' href='#Page_362'>362</a></span>
</p>

<p>
“She’s going to marry Will?” grandma exclaimed,
starting up. “That dear little Yvonne?”
</p>

<p>
“No, grandma, Yvonne will never be Will’s wife.
She has refused.”
</p>

<p>
“What did I say?” grandma replied. “She’s a
doll—she doesn’t know what she wants! Does a young
girl let herself be buried alive like that? Why
shouldn’t she show herself as she is and say: ‘I will!’
when her happiness is at stake? She has much in common
with Will, I am sure. But in this country no one
dares to say what she thinks; people don’t look each
other squarely in the face. If you wish, Ethel, we’ll
leave for America to-morrow!”
</p>

<p>
“Wait a bit, grandma, and then you’ll love Yvonne
with all your heart.”
</p>

<p>
“After what she has done? Never!”
</p>

<p>
“Because of what she has done? Sit down again,
grandma, and I will tell you everything.”
</p>

<p>
“You will waste your breath, Ethel.”
</p>

<p>
“Wait,” Ethel continued. “Will was very much
taken with Yvonne—I am sure that now he would be
much more so if he were only allowed. The fact that
he has been refused shows him so much better the
woman he is losing. It has been a revelation to us. He
was conquered by Yvonne as Desdemona by Othello.
In a way he pitied the young girl’s lot—it was so childish;
there was so little society for her. One ball a year,—a
poor little ball, next to nothing,—a life passed in
the dim light of curtains half drawn, near a deserted
street, the strong contrast with Will’s stormy life in
Chicago.”
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_363' name='Page_363' href='#Page_363'>363</a></span>
</p>

<p>
“That is real life!” said grandma.
</p>

<p>
“Well,” Ethel continued, “everything took hold of
Will, just as a man deafened with the noise of machinery
loves the murmur of bees.”
</p>

<p>
“Oh, it is France Will’s in love with,” grandma
said. “It was his auto journey from Paris and our
excursions round the camp that he was going to marry—it’s
only a fancy already passed.”
</p>

<p>
“No; it will never pass!” answered Ethel. “It is
true all his impressions were personified in Yvonne;
but she shows such sterling qualities that she has no
need to personify anything to be loved.”
</p>

<p>
“You must tell me everything, Ethel,” said grandma.
</p>

<p>
“This is the way it happened. Of course, it was
impossible for Will to speak alone with Yvonne, especially
on such subjects. Besides, he never had the opportunity;
and then—it isn’t done! In France, when
a young man sees a young girl that pleases him, he
asks her parents for her; and her parents accept or
refuse.”
</p>

<p>
“How dreadful!” said grandma.
</p>

<p>
“Will,” Ethel kept on, “was speaking about it one
day to Mme. Riçois.”
</p>

<p>
“Mme. Riçois? What has she got to do with it?”
</p>

<p>
“Why, everything, grandma; everything! If it had
not been for Mme. Riçois we should have gone off to
Morgania without anything being decided. Will
passed his young days between our mines in Montana
and the Chicago Stock Exchange, and never had time
to be in love. Mme. Riçois opened his eyes. I ought
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_364' name='Page_364' href='#Page_364'>364</a></span>
to tell you that she is the most inveterate marrier of the
town.”
</p>

<p>
“A marrier? I thought she was a banker’s wife!”
</p>

<p>
“Oh, she has to do something,” replied Ethel.
“Mme. Riçois makes matches to please herself. The
little woman delights in it. I can imagine her embroidering
on her sleeve, like an officer’s stripes, the number
of marriages she has brought about.”
</p>

<p>
“How dreadful!” said grandma.
</p>

<p>
“She and Will are great friends. Would you believe
it, grandma?—last month she said to him point-blank:
‘Mr. Rowrer, I must find a match for you!’ Will
only laughed. ‘Now, don’t say No!’ Mme. Riçois added
mysteriously; ‘I have a great scheme in my head.’
‘What is your scheme?’ Will asked, more and more
amused. ‘But you mustn’t tell anybody! I wish to
bring about a Franco-American alliance!’ Will didn’t
answer, but I saw he understood, for I was present.”
</p>

<p>
“And what then?” asked grandma.
</p>

<p>
“Naturally they began talking about marriage. Mme.
Riçois told us how she takes hold of the matter; the
measures she takes for the parents: ‘I’ve found a
young man who is quite in your line; this is his situation.’
Thereupon a family council is held, and the
young girl is consulted as a matter of form. Oh, there’s
a whole minute and complicated diplomacy.”
</p>

<p>
“And yet it would be so simple for the young folks
to explain matters to each other!” grandma exclaimed.
</p>

<p>
“That is what Will answered; but Mme. Riçois objected
that this is never done. I thought as much, but
I know France. It was quite new to Will; and he kept
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_365' name='Page_365' href='#Page_365'>365</a></span>
repeating: ‘Is it possible? Is it possible? For my
part, I’d like to be better acquainted with the girl I
marry! I shall certainly never get married in France.’
Then Mme. Riçois spoke up: ‘The main thing is that
you should please the parents.’ ‘But it’s the young
girl I want to please, and to know if I am pleasing her,’
Will said obstinately. ‘M. Rowrer,’ Mme. Riçois said,
‘I have made twenty marriages and they’re all happy;
and I myself married my husband without being acquainted
with him. That was thirty years ago, and
our honeymoon is not over yet!’ ‘Perhaps she is right,’
Will said when Mme. Riçois was gone. ‘Marriages
seem to me as happy here as anywhere. Different countries
have different manners, but at bottom they’re all
the same.’ I’m persuaded, grandma, that from that
day the Franco-American alliance began. I mean that
the remembrance of Mlle. Yvonne was crystallized in
his heart.”
</p>

<p>
While Ethel was speaking the shadows had grown
darker beneath the trees. A purple haze softened the
outlines of the glade. There was deep silence, with now
and then an echo of the hunting-horns, light as the
humming of a fly. Again the hunt found its way, and
the doe, abandoned by her cowardly mate, turned back
toward her haunts. Soon the hallali would push her
to the thicket from which she had started, and where,
at the end of her strength, she would take shelter to
die.
</p>

<p>
“Listen,” Ethel said to grandma, “Will, Phil, and
every one are out there, forgetful of care and trouble,
chasing to its death a poor, innocent animal. Isn’t it
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_366' name='Page_366' href='#Page_366'>366</a></span>
sad?” Then, taking up her interrupted conversation,
she continued: “From that day, especially, Will
thought of Mlle. Yvonne. He saw her again several
times and fell more and more under her charm, in spite
of their commonplace interviews. Each time he discovered
new qualities in her. When I praised her, Will
was glad to listen; and Mme. Riçois was always after
him with the scheme of the alliance. You can imagine
that it didn’t please Will much to be obliged to win
the parents in order to get the girl. Well! he won
over everybody. As to grand’mère, who is the Egeria
of the family, the one that decides difficult cases without
appeal from her judgment—”
</p>

<p>
“Grand’mère said no for Yvonne?” grandma asked.
</p>

<p>
“Grand’mère said yes!”
</p>

<p>
“But if mother and grandmother, uncles and aunts,
and Mme. Riçois say yes, who is it says no?”
</p>

<p>
“Yvonne says no.”
</p>

<p>
“Well, I declare!” grandma exclaimed, in amazement.
It was not the first time she had declared since
she was in France, but never with such energy. In her
voice there were astonishment and anger and admiration
and, most of all, curiosity.
</p>

<p>
“How did it happen, Ethel? Tell me all!” and she
turned her face toward her granddaughter with an expression
of anxiety.
</p>

<p>
“Ah!” Ethel replied, “who would ever suspect that
Yvonne had a romance in her life?”
</p>

<p>
“A romance in Yvonne’s life! What are you telling
me, Ethel? Watched as she is, a romance! It must
have been with another doll!—when she was ten years
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_367' name='Page_367' href='#Page_367'>367</a></span>
old—or when she was playing husband and wife with
some child of her own age!”
</p>

<p>
“Exactly so,” Ethel answered, with a serious look.
“Listen! Yesterday I went in the auto to the Grojeans’,
to say good day as I passed. I suspected nothing.
Everything was shut up, as usual. I knocked
and was let in. The door of the salon opened, and
Yvonne, who had recognized my voice, came toward me
with outstretched hands, and said: ‘Oh, it’s you! How
glad I am! Come in!’”
</p>

<p>
Grandma was immensely interested, and listened, with
her eyes fixed on those of Ethel, with a scarcely perceptible
movement of her lips, as if, in her anxiety to
lose nothing, she were repeating the words to herself.
</p>

<p>
“By the way in which Yvonne took my hand,” Ethel
went on, in a low voice, “I understood something was
happening. The Grojean ladies were there, silent and
much embarrassed, and there was Mme. Riçois, as red as
possible. I looked at Yvonne. ‘My dear friend,’
Yvonne said to me, ‘I am glad you came. Perhaps you
know what is going on. For me it’s my first news of it.
They have just told me of a great scheme,—an offer so
honorable and so flattering—’ That moment, grandma,
I understood they had just communicated to Yvonne
Will’s intentions. By the way in which the ladies listened
to Yvonne, I also learned that she had not yet given
her answer. She was going to speak in my presence.
</p>

<p>
“‘The offer is so flattering,’ Yvonne said, looking
me squarely in the face, ‘and I should have been so very
happy to call you my sister; the marriage would overwhelm
every one here with joy’ (I had only to look at
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_368' name='Page_368' href='#Page_368'>368</a></span>
the beaming faces to see that they expected Yvonne to
say ‘I accept’)—‘the marriage would overwhelm us all
with joy; but there is some one—one only—who would
have too great pain from it. I am not free—I have
given my word to another!’
</p>

<p>
“I wish you had been there, grandma, to judge of
the consternation caused by the word ‘another’! Mme.
de Grojean arose, pale as death.
</p>

<p>
“‘Yvonne, you have given your word to another?
Without your mother knowing it? To whom? Answer!’
</p>

<p>
“‘To my cousin Henri,’ answered Yvonne.
</p>

<p>
“Mme. de Grojean breathed again: ‘To your cousin
Henri! But he is only a child-sweetheart, my dear
daughter; every one has that in her life. Now you
must act like a woman. That was not in earnest.
Henri will give you back your word!’
</p>

<p>
“‘But I shall not take it back!’ said Yvonne.
</p>

<p>
“‘What are you thinking of! Your cousin Henri—nothing
but an employee at the Riçois bank, with no
substantial situation and with no future; do you compare
him with Monsieur Rowrer, for whom, besides, you
have a sentiment? Avow it!—it is nothing to blush for.’
</p>

<p>
“‘I do not blush for it,’ Yvonne said; ‘but I have
a sentiment for Henri also; and, moreover, he has my
word. If he is not rich, he will work. Monsieur Rowrer
is too rich! What an opinion Henri would have of me
if he thought I would marry another just because he is
worth millions, and would abandon him because he
is poor! Surely he would believe so! I would never
dare look him in the face. Henri counts on me,—I
shall be his wife!’”
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_369' name='Page_369' href='#Page_369'>369</a></span>
</p>

<p>
“Oh, brave little Yvonne!” said grandma. “Did she
say that?”
</p>

<p>
“Yes, grandma, she said that; and she was radiant
with beauty as she said it, I can assure you. ‘My dear
Ethel,’ she told me afterward, ‘you see there is nothing
to wound Monsieur Rowrer’s self-love. Tell him I have
the greatest esteem for him, and would have been so glad
to call you my sister, Ethel. But what would you have
done in my place?’
</p>

<p>
“Yvonne must have seen in my looks how deeply I
was moved, and how much I admired her.”
</p>

<p>
“What about the family council—what did it say?”
grandma asked.
</p>

<p>
“‘Is that your final decision?’ Mme. de Grojean demanded
of Yvonne.
</p>

<p>
“‘It is my final decision,’ said Yvonne.
</p>

<p>
“‘Come, then, Yvonne, and be happy!’ and the
mother pressed her to her bosom.”
</p>

<p>
“But the grandmother—that terrible grand’mère?”
</p>

<p>
“Grand’mère kissed Yvonne on the forehead, and
said to her, ‘You’ve done well, my child,’—and then I
came away. That is all, grandma.”
</p>

<p>
The evening was creeping over the forest. The high
clumps of trees stood out in somber masses against the
deep sky. Ethel and grandma had completely forgotten
the hunt; but the sound of the horns drew near.
The exhausted doe was returning, followed close by the
hounds.
</p>

<p>
“Let us go away; the dew is falling,” grandma said
pensively. “Let us go back to the breaks; the hunters
will soon be here.”
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_370' name='Page_370' href='#Page_370'>370</a></span>
</p>

<p>
“Go on alone, grandma; I will wait for them here.
I shall return to the château on horseback.”
</p>

<p>
Ethel remained on the stone bench. When she separated
herself from the hunt the branch of a tree in
a narrow alley had ruffled her hair. She took off her
hat, to put it in order. She was just finishing, when
a hunter, who had doubtless left his horse at the rendezvous
and seemed to be looking for some one, crossed
the glade and passed before her.
</p>

<p>
“Monsieur Phil!” Ethel said, rising.
</p>

<p>
Phil turned his head toward her. Ethel stood upright
in the ruined colonnade. Her blond hair shone
bright against the dark background of ivy-covered rock.
With her black gown, she might have been a nymph in
mourning, staying some passing wanderer, in the depths
of a sacred grove.
</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<img src="images/i-385.png" width="371" height="550" alt="" />
<p class="caption">“Ethel stood upright in the ruined colonnade”</p>
</div>

<p>
Phil was dazzled. He knew he should find her at this
place, for he had seen her leave the hunt near the spot
of the hallali. He wished to see Ethel. He had gathered
in haste a nosegay of wild flowers to offer her. Miss
Rowrer was to see that he had come back for her,—that
he had gathered the flowers for her, that he was thinking
of her. She might, too, see his emotion when he
should offer his simple gift. She would thank him. He
would say he knew not what,—but she would know! He
had sworn to himself to act; the time had come. Nature
herself pushed him forward. There was gladness in
this beautiful evening. The wind stirred the lofty trees
and Phil listened to the hunting-horn as the soldier
sharpens his courage by the rolling of the drums. He
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_371' name='Page_371' href='#Page_371'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_372' name='Page_372' href='#Page_372'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_373' name='Page_373' href='#Page_373'>373</a></span>
advanced respectfully toward Ethel, hiding the flowers
with which he wished to surprise her.
</p>

<p>
“You have something on your mind, Monsieur Phil,”
Ethel said.
</p>

<p>
“Is it as plain as that?” Phil asked, in an uncertain
voice.
</p>

<p>
Like a true lover, he thought he could already read
in her face the feelings which moved himself. He was
almost sorry to have come. He would have been glad
to escape, and he tried to hide his trouble by indifferent
remarks.
</p>

<p>
“You, Miss Rowrer, are radiant this evening.”
</p>

<p>
“It is because I am so happy, Monsieur Phil. Oh, so
happy!”
</p>

<p>
“The evening is so fine,” Phil began; “you—”
</p>

<p>
“I saw yesterday something finer and sweeter than
all that,” Ethel interrupted, with a gesture which took
in the forest and the sumptuous sky. “I saw some one
yesterday repulse with disdain a fortune, to remain
faithful to a childhood love.”
</p>

<p>
Phil stopped short.
</p>

<p>
“It was a young girl,” Ethel went on, slowly, as if
to communicate to him her own conviction,—“a young
girl who believes in the sanctity of promises made when
one is young, when the heart is as clear as the sky,—a
young girl who believes in loyalty to her word once
given, and to oaths exchanged later, when she knew
what she was doing—at the age when one still sees in
love only love itself.”
</p>

<p>
“It might be for me and Helia!” Phil thought.
“Yet, she knows nothing about it.”
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_374' name='Page_374' href='#Page_374'>374</a></span>
</p>

<p>
“That is why I look radiant,” Ethel continued. “Ah,
it refreshes me after what we see so often,—vile hearts
and cowardly consciences.”
</p>

<p>
“This is my punishment,” thought Phil.
</p>

<p>
In full daylight, Ethel would certainly have noticed
his fearful pallor. He stammered out: “One is not
always master of his own heart!”
</p>

<p>
“A true heart,” replied Ethel, “loves but once.
There are not different oaths for each different age of
life.”
</p>

<p>
All this was a lightning-flash to Phil’s soul. Ethel
had never seemed more friendly to him, and she was
radiant and gay. But he no longer thought of her.
He was face to face with himself.
</p>

<p>
“Yet, in spite of one’s self,” Phil answered, in a
hesitating voice, “the sacrifice of first love may be made
to a later one—it sometimes happens.”
</p>

<p>
“It happens every day,” said Ethel; “money talks!”
</p>

<p>
Phil let his nosegay of wild-flowers fall behind him
to the ground.
</p>

<p>
“I won’t keep you, Monsieur Phil,” she said, believing
that she was preventing him from taking part in the
hallali. “Go, now!” she continued pleasantly, “they’re
only waiting for you to cut the doe’s throat—listen,
they’re sounding the death!”
</p>

<p>
Indeed, the forest near them was full of a rising
tumult; lackeys were carrying torches; cries and calls
were heard, and the barking of the hounds grew savage.
The poor doe had come back to her sleeping-place to die.
There was despair in her gasp; and the flaring horns
set up the triumphal song of the hallali.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_375' name='Page_375' href='#Page_375'>375</a></span>
</p>

<p>
“Really, Phil, I do not wish to deprive you of such
pleasure. Go. But you had something in your hand
just now—some flowers, I think. Put them on this
bench. You will find them when you return.”
</p>

<p>
“I have nothing, Miss Ethel,” Phil answered, showing
his empty hands.
</p>

<p>
Every word Ethel had said wounded him cruelly,
though he felt sure she knew nothing of his relations
with Helia. It seemed to him they applied to his own
troubles. They thrilled him to the bottom of his heart.
</p>

<p>
He plunged into the night of the forest, toward the
blood-red glow lighting up the slaughter.

<h3>
CHAPTER I
<br />
ON THE BLUE SEA
</h3>

<p>
A blue sea—a blue sky. The yacht was sailing
under deep azure, reflected back by calm waters.
It was unlike the jolts and staccato teuf-teuf of
the automobile; it was gentle as the swinging of a balloon
in the open heavens. The furrow of foam behind
the yacht was like a trail of clouds.
</p>

<p>
On the promenade-deck, in the shade of the big deck-house,
grandma, Ethel, and Will were taking the air,
stretched out in bamboo chairs. Through the open door
books and newspapers could be seen on the table, and
in the corners of the salon baskets of beautiful flowers
were disposed. The sea breeze mingled with the smell
of roses. Near the yacht’s prow a band was playing
softly. Among the crew there were musicians by trade,—old
sailors of the navy bands. They were training
themselves for gala-days later on—in Sicily, in Greece,
in Morgania. Their low notes reached the group at
the stern like a murmur of distant voices. Ethel looked
abstractedly across the sea to the horizon. She was
thinking of the country she had left behind—of the
mists and gardens where the leaves fall in autumn;
of the countries she was yet to see, with their blue archipelagos,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_380' name='Page_380' href='#Page_380'>380</a></span>
whose white minarets seem milky pearls set
in sapphire.
</p>

<p>
She was almost overwhelmed with remembrances. She
thought of those shores where poets sang of gods and
heroes; of that sea which had reflected, in turn, fable
and faith, where the galley of St. Paul crossed the
meandering track of Ulysses’s bark. She found exquisite
delight in this legendary past. She fancied to herself
Cleopatra and Dido and Morgana, queens who were
all but goddesses, and the Roman matrons, borne across
the waves to the sound of lutes, with their jesters and
their scribes. At her side, Will and grandma were
chatting quietly.
</p>

<p>
“You are a good boy,” grandma said. “I am glad
you got my telegram in time to put an elevator in the
yacht;—perhaps the reason I like new things is because
I am growing old.”
</p>

<p>
“Not at all, grandma,” interrupted Ethel. “What
is stupider than to go climbing up-stairs? It is the
least esthetic of all movements.”
</p>

<p>
“That was my idea!” said grandma.
</p>

<p>
“And the wireless telegraph was mine,” said Will.
</p>

<p>
Will had himself supervised the building of his yacht,
to make it a model of its type. He deserved a Nobel
prize for the practical way in which he had foreseen
everything. But its nautical qualities, and the rigidity
of its double steel shell were as nothing in comparison
with its interior comfort.
</p>

<p>
The yacht could have held two hundred passengers,
and it accommodated only ten. Its furnishings and
arrangements were sumptuous. The deck-house was a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_381' name='Page_381' href='#Page_381'>381</a></span>
hundred feet long. In front were a card-room and the
apartments of the captain; all the rest was taken for
great cabins, each with its boudoir and bath-room.
</p>

<p>
Through the music-room, where the breath of the
open sea brought to grandma, Ethel, and Will the smell
of the roses, they would go down to the great hall wainscoted
in unvarnished cedar, which framed decorative
panels. Farther on in the suite of rooms was the library,
with its wide, red-leather sofas. Above the shelves
twelve caryatids, in yellow marble, upheld the plinth.
There were radiators for heat and ventilators for coolness,
with telephones and electric buttons everywhere.
Their bells gave a thrill of life from end to end of the
yacht.
</p>

<p>
Ethel was on the point of ringing for her maid, when
Suzanne appeared. She brought the plaids, fearing the
evening freshness might incommode Mme. Rowrer or
Miss Rowrer.
</p>

<p>
“Suzanne,” Ethel said, while she was putting a plaid
over her shoulders, “I don’t see Monsieur Phil. Perhaps
he is showing the yacht to Mademoiselle Helia.”
</p>

<p>
“No; Monsieur Phil is not showing the yacht. Monsieur
Phil is giving a lemon to M. Caracal to suck. M.
Caracal suffers martyrdom. The sighs of M. Caracal
rend one’s heart. Mademoiselle Helia is in her cabin,
reading.”
</p>

<p>
Suzanne, since she had become a soubrette, said “Mademoiselle”
when she spoke of Helia. She had perfect
tact; she was the ideal soubrette. She had accepted
eagerly Ethel’s offer to accompany her to Morgania.
The life she was leading with Perbaccho wearied her;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_382' name='Page_382' href='#Page_382'>382</a></span>
and then, to hear Poufaille always repeating the same
thing over,—to be always knocking on the same skull
at the same hours,—she was tired of it all.
</p>

<p>
Will at first intended to take Poufaille along to help
the cook, but he prudently gave up the project when
he heard Poufaille explaining his ideas on pig’s-rump
and garlic, and goat’s-milk cheese. So Suzanne not
only escaped from Poufaille for the present, but she
served Miss Rowrer, whom she adored; and, moreover,
she followed Helia and Phil. She guessed that something
had lately passed between them. She was devoured
by curiosity to know how the romance would end.
Was it possible that Phil, who formerly had been so good
and upright, could have changed to such a degree? A
hundred times over she had been called to be a witness
to his love and a confidante of his oaths. Ah, men,
men! for them the broomstick—<i>et aïe donc</i>!
</p>

<p>
“Tell me,” Ethel said, “is Mademoiselle Helia glad,
now that she has come? I had Monsieur Phil invite her,
and she refused at first. I had to insist myself, and
almost get angry, to make her accept.”
</p>

<p>
“Oh, yes, Mademoiselle Helia is very glad!” and Suzanne,
having arranged the plaids, lifted to Miss Rowrer
eyes in which she might have read infinite gratitude for
so much goodness.
</p>

<p>
“I need you, Helia,” Ethel had urged; “you know
it well! I count on you for my lessons in physical culture,
and you know I’ve got it in my head to take you
to my father’s university. There are charming young
girls there, and you will teach them how to be strong
and beautiful. Besides, the voyage will do so much
good to Sœurette. Come—you’ll be at home!”
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_383' name='Page_383' href='#Page_383'>383</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Helia had accepted. To travel with Phil would be to
lengthen her torture; but, at least, she would see
him.
</p>

<p>
At first, amid all these marble statues and bronze
reliefs, Helia felt herself intimidated, habituated as
she was to the coarsely painted scene-canvases and
papier-mâché bronzes. But Ethel treated her as an
equal—Ethel, who had the art to be respected without
being unapproachable.
</p>

<p>
“Ask them to come up,” Ethel said to Suzanne.
“It’s the finest hour of the day.”
</p>

<p>
The sea was mild. Great clouds were climbing above
the horizon, while an enormous sun was slowly setting
in splendor of molten gold.
</p>

<p>
“The duke was right,” Ethel said to Will. “From
the point of view of Paris the legend of Morgana might
seem ridiculous, but here, in the grandeur of such scene-setting,
even the supernatural seems normal. How far
away are the ant-hills of Paris and London! Only think
how somewhere people are agitating themselves in fog
and smoke, while we are sailing straight for dreamland
and—isn’t it curious?—a duchy with sorceresses and
fairies in its history, where legends a thousand years old
still move the people. I wish to believe in it—I wish to
see the return of Morgana!”
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">“Keep thy flight to the West, bold sailor;</p>
<p>The land thou seekest shall arise,</p>
<p>Even though it existed not,</p>
<p>From the depths of the waves to welcome thee.”</p>
</div></div>

<p>
It was Phil, who arrived ahead of Caracal. He had
heard Ethel, and capped her thought with verses from
Schiller.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_384' name='Page_384' href='#Page_384'>384</a></span>
</p>

<p>
“How is your patient, Monsieur Phil?” asked Ethel;
“how is M. Caracal? Seasickness is a sad affair; even
animals suffer from it—the ox, the ass, the hog, the
monkey—”
</p>

<p>
“And especially man,” said Caracal, following Phil.
</p>

<p>
Caracal thanked Miss Rowrer. He was better. The
responsibility of the old French politeness weighed on
Caracal. He went through his most graceful manners,
lifting his little finger in the air, and smiling and
scraping his foot. And then—<i>crac</i>! a diving bow, with
his lip turned up, to kiss one’s hand—or to bite it.
</p>

<p>
He wore a faultless suit, and an artistic cravat, which
the wind swelled out like a banner. He redoubled his
politeness to grandma, a sure means, in his mind, to win
her granddaughter. He hummed to himself a music-hall
refrain:
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="o1">“Pour avoir la fille</p>
<p>Aimable et gentille,</p>
<p>C’est à la maman</p>
<p>Qu’il faut d’abord faire des compliments!”</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="o2">(“To gain the daughter,</p>
<p class="i2">Sweet and pretty,</p>
<p>To the old mother</p>
<p class="i2">Sing your ditty!”)</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>
He rhymed sonnets to Miss Rowrer, and trotted out
his erudition, working up his Baedeker in his cabin, and
astonishing every one by his qualifications as a cicerone.
</p>

<p>
“M. Caracal would make an ideal courier,”  thought
grandma.
</p>

<p>
Caracal, out of the tail of his eye, glanced at the
books on the salon table. “The House of Glass,” which
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_385' name='Page_385' href='#Page_385'>385</a></span>
had just appeared before their departure, lay, uncut,
under a pile of magazines. Caracal was a little annoyed;
but, with an author’s pride, he hesitated to call
Miss Rowrer’s attention again to his own novel.
</p>

<p>
“A wireless for Miss Rowrer.” The captain’s boy
approached, with his cap off and a paper in his hand.
</p>

<p>
“Where does it come from?” Ethel asked.
</p>

<p>
“From a ship off there.”
</p>

<p>
Ethel instinctively lifted her eyes to the mast, which
seemed to be throwing out its feelers into space. Then
she opened the paper and read:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
Captain <i>Far East</i> en route New York wishes good journey to
Captain <i>Columbia</i>. R. K. Rowrer’s orders to put himself at disposition
of yacht. Bad news from Morgania—land excursions dangerous.
Any message for New York.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Ethel arose. One point appeared on the horizon and
then another.
</p>

<p>
“It’s the <i>Far East</i> and the <i>Far West</i>,” said Will.
“They’ve been carrying bridge iron to Africa for the
Cape-to-Cairo railway, and machinery for the Nyanza
ferry-boat company. They belong to pa.”
</p>

<p>
“Really!” said Ethel, looking at the two ships coming
into sight along the horizon.
</p>

<p>
“Boy!” she called, giving him the answer:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
Sailing straight for Morgania—danger adds to attraction. Our
love to dear old pa!
</p>
</div>

<p>
Ethel, with her sea-glass, could observe the ships saluting
the yacht; the flags tumbled at the mizzen.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_386' name='Page_386' href='#Page_386'>386</a></span>
</p>

<p>
She felt a thrill of pride. Roman matrons and
Cleopatras and Didos, slowly dragged over the sea
by their chained galley-slaves, what were they beside
her? How much better it was to live nowadays!
She felt herself more powerful than they had ever
been. Space seemed bringing her the salutes of the
East and of the distant West. She remained standing
until the ships were lost to sight in the evening
mists.
</p>

<p>
They were cruising along the Italian coast, visiting
now one spot and now another. Sometimes there were
cool streets bordered with palaces whose windows were
without glass. The presence of the yachting-party drew
swarms of <i>ragazzi</i>, boys and girls, more importunate
than Jersey mosquitos, and harassing them for <i>baiocchi</i>
and <i>madonne</i>.
</p>

<p>
Again, there were islands which from afar were
like bouquets of flowers, and from near smelled of
cheese and fried fish and garlic. Capri, with the sea
like a liquid sky at its feet, lifted its houses along terraces
like shelves. It was nothing but a going up and
coming down.
</p>

<p>
“This is a perpendicular country,” was Ethel’s observation.
“We are like flies walking along a wall.”
</p>

<p>
On the days when there was no climbing of the
islands that sink abruptly to the sea, the party could
look at them from the deck or the library, as they
passed. Ethel took the opportunity for her physical
training, or put herself out of breath on a stationary
bicycle, like those on which the travelers on the trans-Siberian
line get the rust from their legs.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_387' name='Page_387' href='#Page_387'>387</a></span>
</p>

<p>
“You’ll tire yourself, Miss Rowrer,” Helia said to
her, when she saw what ardor she displayed.
</p>

<p>
“No, no!” said Ethel, “just show me how to do it.”
</p>

<p>
Helia went through a few movements with consummate
ease. There was no getting out of breath, no
swelling of veins—neck and shoulders and arms were
smooth as marble; for exercise only developed in her
the exquisite purity of her form.
</p>

<p>
“Oh, Helia!” Ethel added, “show me how I can have
a neck and shoulders and arms like yours.”
</p>

<p>
During these short training lessons her friendship
for Helia grew; and it is possible Ethel’s only ambition
was to have arms like Helia. But it was not such
an ambition which the press had been attributing to
her for some time back. For the newspapers were always
talking about her. When the yacht entered the
smallest port, it drew more attention than a war
squadron. The cabbage-leaf papers of Calabria and
Sicily all had something to say of Miss Rowrer. They
spoke of her as a wild woman, because she had bought
and saved from death the dog whom the natives were
asphyxiating, in honor of foreign tourists, amid the
noxious gases of a sulphur grotto. Then they had a
story of some hermit on a cliff, whom she wished, so
it seemed, to take to Chicago to have him bless her
father’s stock-yard from the top of a sky-scraper!
</p>

<p>
“What fools!” said Will. “They’d do better to
put glass in their windows and cultivate their <i>nespoli</i>
and <i>pomidoro</i> than lose their time in such silliness.
It’s true that time is not worth much in a country
where Stromboli and Vesuvius take the place of our
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_388' name='Page_388' href='#Page_388'>388</a></span>
Pittsburgs and Homesteads—where there’s nothing
smoking on the horizon except some old volcano!”
</p>

<p>
Yet the yachting-party found pleasure in the halts
when, for a change, they went to dine at the hotels. The
rushing down-stairs of the clerks and porters and
maîtres-d’hôtel, who got suddenly into rank and waited
for their orders, amused them. For the landlords their
landing was a signal to make all the hay they could
while the sun was shining.
</p>

<p>
Not the cabbage-leaf papers alone, but the great journals
also, printed Ethel’s name. At least, she concluded
this must be the case one day when she remained on board
while Will and the others visited the museum at Palermo.
Ethel had letters to write and sat herself down
near the music-room under an awning. The yacht was
moored beside a great steamer for tourists. Without
being seen she could hear, above her head, the talk of
these cosmopolitan people, familiar with the Pyramids
and the Acropolis, the Smyrna bazaars and Monte
Carlo. The whole international swarm knew the Columbia
by name. On the steamer they were talking
travel and trade and the weather. Ethel heard her
name pronounced along with the rest. They were discussing
her probable marriage with the Duke of Morgania—“a
glorious name in Europe.” “Do you know
what Chartered is quoted at on the Stock Exchange?”
“They’ll be a magnificent couple!” “The big Pyramid
is seven hundred feet less than the Eiffel Tower.”
“She’d be a charming duchess!” “The best chance
Morgania ever had!”
</p>

<p class="caption">“She dreamed under a sky studded with stars”</p>
</div>

<p>
Then all the voices were lost in the siren’s wailing,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_389' name='Page_389' href='#Page_389'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_390' name='Page_390' href='#Page_390'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_391' name='Page_391' href='#Page_391'>391</a></span>
long drawn out. The steamer shook itself gently, and
issued from the port, leaving Ethel in a reverie.
</p>

<p>
“Reigning duchess! Queen of Antioch! Lady Knight
of Malta!” All this—she acknowledged it to herself—had
already passed through her brain. It had even
amused her to see how timid the duke was in her presence.
She had to say but a word,—not even that,—merely
to encourage him with a smile, to see him at her
feet. But the newspapers were in too great a hurry.
They spoke of something that was not yet decided. She
would see; she had never so well appreciated her power
as since her departure from Marseilles. Everybody in
the world seemed to know her. True enough, across the
Red Sea and India and Japan,—everywhere, to the other
side of the earth, as far as ’Frisco, it would have been
just the same.
</p>

<p>
The voyage continued tranquilly. Villages at the
foot of the rugged Calabrian cliffs saw the yacht passing
by, white upon the blue sea, or at night shining with
lights like a meteor.
</p>

<p>
At that hour, most of all after dinner, it was pleasant
on the bridge. Will walked backward and forward,
and smoked his cigar. Grandma, half asleep, looked at
the sea, which reminded her of her Western prairies.
At her side, to give her pleasure, Phil picked his banjo.
Caracal was bored; he had verified the fact that no one
had yet opened his book.
</p>

<p>
Ethel had other things to do. Stretched out in her
bamboo chair, she dreamed under a sky studded with
stars.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_392' name='Page_392' href='#Page_392'>392</a></span>
</p>

</div>
<div class="chapter">

<h3>
CHAPTER II
<br />
ETHEL’S VICTORY
</h3>

<p>
Phil, ever since the day of the hunt, had also been
living in a dream.
</p>

<p>
He was sure that Ethel knew nothing of his
past. He even suspected the events to which she had alluded,
for he knew Will’s story well. Moreover, she had
since then shown herself more amiable than ever to him.
He might have thought himself more encouraged than
ever to pay her court and to forget Helia more and
more. But just the contrary happened. Within himself
he felt a passion storm going on, with sudden illumination
of vivid lightning flashes. Then all sank
back into shadow.
</p>

<p>
He no longer dared look Helia in the face. Under
Ethel’s clear eyes his conscience had awakened.
</p>

<p>
One evening, weary of the ideas that beset him, Phil
had thrown himself on a sofa in the music-room, when
he saw Ethel enter, seat herself, and absently take up
a book which chanced to be lying there. She cut one
page and looked through it, two pages, ten pages.
Then, suddenly, she arose angrily. Phil was astounded.
</p>

<p>
“Do you understand?” Ethel asked him. “He dares
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_393' name='Page_393' href='#Page_393'>393</a></span>
to offer me this filthy book with the author’s compliments!
I have only read a few lines, and it nauseates
me.”
</p>

<p>
“Of what book are you speaking, Miss Rowrer?”
Phil asked.
</p>

<p>
“Of ‘The House of Glass,’ which Caracal has dared
to offer me.” And Ethel showed Phil the volume, with
its modern-style cover decorated by creeping plants and
monkeys’ tails.
</p>

<p>
“Would you believe it?” Ethel continued. “The
poor fool is trying to be gallant with me. Every day
he composes a sonnet in my honor. There’s no great
harm in that; but since he is the author of ‘The House
of Glass,’ it has another meaning. Here, Phil, take the
book, I beg of you, and throw it overboard. But, wait
a minute, we’ll throw to-day’s sonnet with it. Only
give me time to open the envelop—you’ll see how grotesque
it is.”
</p>

<p>
Ethel opened the envelop, but she had scarcely
glanced through the letter it contained when she grew
pale with wrath and pride.
</p>

<p>
“What an outrage!” she exclaimed, in her fury.
“See, Phil, Caracal made a mistake in addressing his
envelop. He has sent the sonnet on to Paris and put
here, instead of it, a letter to Vieillecloche. Richard
the Lion-hearted! Those attacks which vexed me so,—they
came from him. He has a family arrangement
for it with Vieillecloche. Look, Phil, read, read! What
do you think of that? Is it not infamous? He attacks
us for pay!”
</p>

<p>
Phil was indignant. The letter left no possible doubt.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_394' name='Page_394' href='#Page_394'>394</a></span>
He already could see Caracal disembarked in a hurry
at the first port, and going down the gangway crushed
by his shame.
</p>

<p>
“But he also attacked you once, Phil. How is it you
didn’t pull his ears?”
</p>

<p>
“That was my great desire!” answered Phil.
</p>

<p>
“But you did not do it!”
</p>

<p>
“Let me tell you—”
</p>

<p>
“You did not do it!”
</p>

<p>
Phil, without changing a detail, told the whole story—the
rage which had pushed him on to hunt for Caracal,
and his feelings at sight of the poor creature a prey
to his own dreams, with anguish on his tear-stained
face.
</p>

<p>
“That is why I did not do it, Miss Rowrer,” said Phil.
</p>

<p>
“Ah!” Ethel exclaimed, as she looked at Phil.
</p>

<p>
There was a moment of silence.
</p>

<p>
“Throw book and letter into the sea,” Ethel concluded.
“And, I beseech you, not a word of all this
to any one!”
</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<a name="i-409" id="i-409"></a>
<img src="images/i-409.png" width="342" height="550" alt="" />
<p class="caption">“She arose angrily”</p>
</div>

<p>
Phil went away, and Ethel remained alone. Within
her there was something like a hurricane. What! those
men, those man-monkeys who had been harassing her
ever since she came to Paris,—it was all to make her
buy their silence. How infamous! It humiliated her
to see such obscure names mixed up with her life. And
one of them was under obligations to her, living under
her roof and sitting at her table! And it was he who
offered her a book which might have been written by
a drunken ape! Ah! if she had only known of his
special talents, he would not be there now—that public
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_395' name='Page_395' href='#Page_395'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_396' name='Page_396' href='#Page_396'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_397' name='Page_397' href='#Page_397'>397</a></span>
malefactor, that little round-shouldered wretch, who
dared to write her sonnets! What should she do with
Caracal? Abandon him on a desert island? Or simply
throw him into the water? No, not that. Hang him to
the mast like a pirate? Come, now—she would not
trouble her brain hunting condign punishments for him.
She left the music-room, and walked on the deck; and
at last, as if to wind up her long monologue with herself,
she concluded: “Caracal is crazy!”
</p>

<p>
This idea, which put anger to one side and left room
for pity, restored to Ethel her self-possession. “I will
deal with him later on,” she said.
</p>

<p>
The immense distance between herself and such a
man appeared to her all at once. Caracal seemed very
little to her. And what moral wretchedness! All his
energy was aimed at obtaining money, and he did not
even succeed! And how punished he would be some
day, when he should see his bad actions taking root and
growing, and their poison doing its work.
</p>

<p>
Could she even understand the case? Who could
ever know the extreme need, the passions which urge
on a man like Caracal? Perhaps his was not consummate
vice; perhaps he would repent some day. He was
poor and alone, and she was powerful and rich, and
perhaps might be a reigning duchess to-morrow—if she
would only say yes with a nod. Yet here she was allowing
herself to be embittered by the snarling of a
poor fool. A queen, and she could not pardon! Phil
had been more generous and humane than she!
</p>

<p>
She made a great effort to conquer her remorseless
attitude—and won.

<h3>
CHAPTER III
<br />
A CASTLE OF THE ADRIATIC
</h3>

<p>
When the yacht moored in front of the ducal
castle of Morgania, Morgana was surely absent,
for no fantastic mirage welcomed their
coming. Out of courtesy to the duke, a salvo of cannon
was fired from the yacht; and the salute was returned,
shot by shot, from the bastion.
</p>

<p>
“Poor duke!” said grandma. “We are making him
waste his powder!”
</p>

<p>
The yachting-party witnessed, indeed, a grand spectacle.
It was the country itself, with the forests in its
valleys and its uplands ragged with wild rocks. You
could imagine paths winding around precipices, and
rivulets falling down the crags like shining swords.
High up and far away, with its base lost in the mist
and its summit lighted by the rays of the sun, the
Kutsch-kom Mountain closed in the horizon.
</p>

<p>
The port was at the end of a gulf, with two gigantic
cliffs reaching out at the sides. The yachting-party was
still fresh from their view of the white terraces of the
Achilleion of Corfu, with its marble statues and its
orange-trees; and they looked with astonishment at this
corner full of shadows, with the thousand-year-old castle
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_399' name='Page_399' href='#Page_399'>399</a></span>
perched upon its rock. It was seated on lofty and solid
buttresses. A rampart flanked by thick bastions defended
it; and stunted box-trees stretched over it their
dark branches. Behind, wide, deep passages led up to
battlemented towers.
</p>

<p>
At its feet the little city interlaced its narrow streets.
You felt that it was builded in feudal times, and had
been constructed under the master’s eye, and by his
orders. Later, it had pushed back its walls and extended
into the plain. A dike by the beach, strewn with fallen
boulders, sheltered it against the sea. A road up an
embankment, broken by intervals of steps, led up from
the city to the castle. Everything seemed weighted down
with the years,—the Byzantine domes of churches, Oriental
minarets, Frankish towers; everywhere you felt
the succession of the ages.
</p>

<p>
“It is a romantic country,” said Ethel. “There is
no need of a mirage to believe one’s self in the heart of
the Middle Ages. We have only to look at the setting of
the scene to be transported centuries back. All these old
things must reek with superstition. If you stayed here
long, Will, you, too, would end by believing in Morgana.
See,” added Ethel, as amused as a child, “see,
she is smiling at us! That shining point up there, above
the Gothic portal—it is Morgana’s window,—the window
the duke was telling us about,—do you remember,
grandma? Up there, in the tower front!”
</p>

<p>
Everybody looked where she was pointing, but just
then the reflection of the sun’s rays disappeared, and
the window was quenched in shadow.
</p>

<p>
The bells of the city, ringing the Angelus in the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_400' name='Page_400' href='#Page_400'>400</a></span>
evening calm, sounded like a salutation to Morgana.
They had seen Loreto and its Casa Santa, brought
thither by angels; the cathedral church of San Ciriaco,
in Ancona, once a temple of Venus; Ravenna, where
the heroine Amalberga was deified; Venice, protected
by its winged lions. So, after their long cruise in this
sea of legend, they came well prepared to study the
people’s superstitions and the folk-lore of Morgania.
They tasted, in anticipation, the pleasure of seeing the
daily life of the castle, wherein there had been no change
for centuries.
</p>

<p>
Every one seemed to have important things to do. On
the morrow Phil was to put his Morgana picture in
place, and retouch it on the spot. Ethel and Will were
to go on an excursion. Caracal would delve into
ducal archives. Grandma was already <i>blasé</i> on these
cities of pigmies, wherein music takes the place of the
noise of foundries, and where men sleep with their heads
in the shade and their feet in the sun while they digest
their garlic. Grandma would remain on deck and look
at Morgania over her glasses.
</p>

<p>
“I hope, M. Caracal, you will write a book on
Morgania and its folk-lore,” said Ethel. “You would
find pathetic things into which this people must have put
their love and faith. It would be a rest after the cruel
studies which you devote, it seems, to modern society.”
</p>

<p>
In her manner of speaking to Caracal, it was perceptible
that Ethel wished to be merciful. That evening
when she had discovered everything, Phil hardly dared
come up on deck; but the next day he was greatly surprised
to find Ethel as smiling as ever, and Caracal
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_401' name='Page_401' href='#Page_401'>401</a></span>
amiable as usual. Ethel was even talking with interest
to Caracal, asking questions and seeming to study the
man.
</p>

<p>
From the dining-room, through the port-holes, they
could see the gray mass of towers. A few lights were
shining along the hills; and beyond stretched away a
great wall of rocks and the somber woods. The yachting-party
admired the grandeur of the landscape as they
ate their peach ice-cream.
</p>

<p>
“I want to see the sorceress,” said Ethel, “provided
they don’t accuse me of wishing to take her off to America
like Richard the Lion-hearted.”
</p>

<p>
“As for me,” said Helia, “I should dearly like to see
the defile where Morgana stopped the invasion.”
</p>

<p>
“We shall go together,” answered Ethel; “and I
hope the gentlemen will accompany us. For me, it is
a place of pilgrimage; it will do us good to compare our
useless lives with that of the heroine. We shall gather
from it resolution to be brave and energetic, without
prejudice, of course, to our right to cry out for the least
little ache. Never mind; for a few hours we shall have
understood what duty is.”
</p>

<p>
“But duty doesn’t always mean that one should
fight,” said Phil. “It takes other forms as well.”
</p>

<p>
“It always consists in fighting,” said Ethel; “but
not always against some one else—oftenest it is against
ourselves.”
</p>

<p>
“There is no one slain in that case,” remarked Caracal.
“The blows we strike ourselves are never mortal—we
are careful to strike with the flat of the blade!”
</p>

<p>
“That’s the way they punish cowards,” said Ethel.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_402' name='Page_402' href='#Page_402'>402</a></span>
</p>

<p>
They were interrupted by a lackey announcing the
coming of the Duke of Morgania.
</p>

<p>
They had just finished dining, and they went up on
deck to receive the duke. Helia and Sœurette retired.
</p>

<p>
Without, everything was in shadow. A dense crowd
thronged the jetty. The searchlight of the yacht threw
its rays upon the shore and brought out here and there
white minarets and roofs and domes. A swarm of people—men,
women, and children—half blinded by the light,
stared at the yacht. The shining of their eyes could be
seen; here there was the glitter of a poniard-handle,
and there the glow of silver buckles. There were men in
great drugget cloaks over their white fustanelle, and
women clad in long red garments, which fell straight as
on figures in shrines. Anxious faces might be seen, with
scared expressions; and from the crowd, pressed together
like a herd, mounted up a confused murmur.
</p>

<p>
The word of command was heard; and there was a
sound of oars striking the water. A small boat came
alongside, a rope was thrown out, and the ladder lowered;
and Monseigneur, the Duke of Morgania, came
up. The light fell full upon him. The duke bowed respectfully
to the ladies, and shook the men by the hand,
like a boon companion.
</p>

<p>
“I’m not putting you out too much, I hope?”
</p>

<p>
“We are delighted to see you,” said grandma. “Come
into the music-room.”
</p>

<p>
“Don’t be alarmed, monseigneur; we shall not have
music!” added Ethel.
</p>

<p>
“You are right,” said the duke; “no music is worth
the sound of friendly voices. How happy I am to see
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_403' name='Page_403' href='#Page_403'>403</a></span>
you again! I thank you for coming,—I seem to be
leaving my exile.”
</p>

<p>
The descendant of Morgana and of Rhodaïs offered
his arm to grandma, to enter the salon. As soon as
they were seated, conversation began, as if they had
left each other but the day before; it was familiar and
gay, as among members of the same social world.
</p>

<p>
“What is the news in Paris?”
</p>

<p>
“We do not come from there. Talk to us about the
sorceress,” said Ethel.
</p>

<p>
“On the contrary, let us not speak of her! The country
is upside down; every one is losing his head. I should
not be astonished if, to-morrow, when the people see you,
they should all cry, ‘Morgana!’”
</p>

<p>
“Why, that would amuse me immensely!” said Ethel.
“How is it possible for you to be bored in such a country?
It must be always interesting.”
</p>

<p>
“Oh, very, very interesting!” said the duke. “But
I should prefer something else.”
</p>

<p>
“And yet, to lead the people!—and then, what about
your heroines,—Morgana and Rhodaïs and Bertha,—all
those valiant women?”
</p>

<p>
“Ah! that’s what we need nowadays,” said the duke.
“Perhaps one valiant woman like those ancestors of
mine would save Morgania!”
</p>

<p>
“Is Morgania threatened to that degree?” asked
Ethel. “We were counting on long excursions into the
interior.”
</p>

<p>
“You come at a bad time for that, Miss Rowrer!”
</p>

<p>
In a few words he gave an impressive description of
the state of the country. Everywhere was the expectation
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_404' name='Page_404' href='#Page_404'>404</a></span>
of war, with all its disquiet. Fields were uncultivated,
and the region of the Moratscha was already all
but emptied of its inhabitants. Bands of fugitives were
coming in every day, with a pitiful procession of Christians,
chased from Albania by the Turks. “You speak
of excursions to the Castellum. I greatly fear you’d
not be able to do water-color sketches there. At most
you might take kodak shots at brutes always ready to
fire on strangers and pillage them. The state of things
is insupportable. However, I will have you accompanied
by a squad of soldiers.”
</p>

<p>
“How will it all end?” Phil asked.
</p>

<p>
“I count on the aid of the Great Powers,” said the
duke.
</p>

<p>
Will and Phil could not help smiling. The duke himself
watched the smoke of his cigar with an enigmatic
air. Perhaps he saw in it the image of the stability
and fixity of design of the Great Powers.
</p>

<p>
“Don’t count too much on them,” said Will.
</p>

<p>
“Meanwhile,” the duke added, “you must consider
yourselves quite safe in my stronghold, where I shall be
greatly honored to offer you hospitality. Your rooms
will be as large as churches, and you shall have an immense
stone staircase for yourselves alone.”
</p>

<p>
“You must be kind enough to excuse me, Monsieur le
Duc,” said grandma.
</p>

<p>
“Well, Morgania is yours!” the duke answered, as he
rose to take his departure. “I shall be only too happy
to be useful to you,—you must dispose of me at your
pleasure!”
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_405' name='Page_405' href='#Page_405'>405</a></span>
</p>

<p>
As the duke crossed the threshold, he saw Sœurette
running by.
</p>

<p>
“I know that child,” said the duke.
</p>

<p>
“And her sister also!” Ethel said, repressing a smile,
for Parisian gossip had informed her of the duke’s admiration
for Helia. “She is on board, traveling with
us.”
</p>

<p>
“Let her, too, come to the castle,” said the duke.
“The little girl will be charming company for my son;
his life is not any too gay, and with these continual
troubles the future is still darker for a ducal heir.”
</p>

<p>
“Poor child!” said grandma.
</p>

<p>
The duke, before he left them, insisted again on the
danger of excursions. He was getting ready to go down
when Helia appeared, looking for Sœurette.
</p>

<p>
“Mlle. Helia,” said the duke, “I am happy to see you
again,” and he bowed to her with his perfect tact.
</p>

<p>
Helia had heard the end of the conversation. She
came just as the duke was speaking of a possible invasion.
</p>

<p>
“And you, Mlle. Helia,” he added, with a smiling air
of protection, “what would you do if you were attacked?
You know there is going to be fighting in our country.”
</p>

<p>
“That’s very easily settled, monseigneur,” Helia
said, with a voice in which there was a thrill as of self-sacrifice.
“If there’s question of fighting, I will do my
part!”
</p>

<p>
“What an Amazon!” the duke said, looking at Helia
with a smile. “So if the occasion demanded you would
do like my ancestresses: you’d sleep on the mountainside,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_406' name='Page_406' href='#Page_406'>406</a></span>
in the snow and rain night and day, to give an
example!”
</p>

<p>
“Yes, monseigneur,” said Helia.
</p>

<p>
The duke made his final bows, with a diplomatic sense
of degrees answering to the differences of rank between
grandma and Ethel and Helia, and then went down to
his boat, which was rowed rapidly away.
</p>

<p>
There was not a cheer on the shore for the duke. A
dull silence reigned on the jetty, broken only by confused
expressions of anxiety. Fingers pointed to the
yacht, as if to say, “What is it?” No doubt they imagined
it to be some powerful envoy of the great nations.
Meanwhile the duke disappeared in the night.
</p>

<p>
The searchlight wavered for a moment, and then
fell on the castle. The people on the jetty were no
longer visible, lost in the shadow. But the murmur of
the crowd was still heard, and a dim reflected light
gave the city a phantasmal look, while beyond might
be divined the deserted country, the mountains and
valleys.
</p>

<p>
“I don’t understand the duke,” said Ethel, in a low
voice. “He should be thrilled at the thought of recreating
a people. The duke must be wanting in resolution.
I seem to see him in his castle regulating questions
of etiquette, brightening up a little the faded gilt
of his stage-setting, and regretting Paris—a stranger to
his people’s aspirations. Yet how many things are to be
done here—wretchedness to console, ignorance to enlighten!
In his place I would never have waited for
them to come to fetch me back from Paris.”
</p>

<p>
Ethel suddenly interrupted herself. “See!” she
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_407' name='Page_407' href='#Page_407'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_408' name='Page_408' href='#Page_408'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_409' name='Page_409' href='#Page_409'>409</a></span>
called to Will and grandma, “see, Morgana smiles to us
again! See the light yonder, behind Helia!”
</p>

<p>
Just then the searchlight illumined the top of the
Gothic portal. The Morgana window glittered through
the night.
</p>

<p>
“Do not stir, I entreat you!” Ethel said to Helia.
“The window throws a halo around you!”
</p>

<p>
Indeed, they could see the dark profile of Helia in
relief against the glittering background. She was superb,
standing upright, with her head raised proudly,
and one hand grasping a ratline of the mast. She
looked as if she were wielding an immense lance, like a
warrior-woman of heroic days.

<h3>
CHAPTER IV
<br />
THE LITTLE DUKE
</h3>

<p>
The next day, as they entered the Hall of the Ancestors,
grandma dropped the duke’s arm to seat
herself in a great chair. But the chair was in
carved wood and very hard. Decidedly, this was a feudal
castle, and much less comfortable than a Chicago home.
</p>

<p>
Ethel thanked the little Adalbert with a big kiss. The
child, accompanied by his father, had been the guide
of Ethel and grandma. He had climbed up and down
steps too high for him; but Ethel gave him her hand;
and the child explained and mentioned names, as he
showed mosaics and statues in the crypt. “My grandfather,
Amalfrid IX, my ancestor Enguerrand, Lady
Rhodaïs, Bertha, St. Morgana”;—one would have said
he was the familiar genius of the place, a little wandering
soul of the dead, doing to the living the honors of the
past.
</p>

<p>
When they issued forth from these gloomy vaults,
Adalbert hastened to go off and play with Sœurette
behind the pillars of the great hall.
</p>

<p>
For some days the place was the scene of constant
festivity. The noise of laughter was heard; there was
talk and the movement of life, and roses garnished the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_411' name='Page_411' href='#Page_411'>411</a></span>
vases. Servants carried back and forth cakes and fruits.
At times, beneath the arches, there rolled an uncertain
harmony,—it was Ethel trying the old piano.
</p>

<p>
What a change for Adalbert, who was used to being
alone with his aged tutor. Until then his walks along
the ramparts, amid the box-trees twisted by the wind,
had been his chief amusement. How often he had wished
to go down and untie the old boat moored at the foot of
the wall, and sail out into the bay!
</p>

<p>
But the duke, with all his frequent traveling, had
the child whom he adored looked after with the greatest
care. It was the last of his race,—their last hope. If
the child should die, to which of his powerful neighbors
would the duchy fall as a prey? So the child grew
up in the old castle with the portraits of his forefathers
looking down at him; and his imagination awoke to the
recital of ancient legends. In his dreams by night he
saw gentle visions bending over him. Now, all had grown
alive, and the visions were realities. There were big
friends to dance him on their knees; there was a kind
old fairy speaking softly to him in a foreign tongue.
Two young maidens, more beautiful than those of his
dreams, took him in their arms; and for playmates he
had a delightful little girl who taught him games and
called him Monseigneur. Ethel looked at Adalbert playing
with Sœurette; the child was bright and gay, and
she complimented the duke.
</p>

<p>
“It is because your visit gives him such pleasure,”
said the duke,—“as much as to me, were it possible! I
don’t know what he will do when you go away,—poor
Adalbert! He will be very sorry.”
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_412' name='Page_412' href='#Page_412'>412</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Ethel looked thoughtful. The duke leaned over the
back of her chair, and, so as to be heard by her alone,
spoke slowly:
</p>

<p>
“It will be his apprenticeship in life. Separation
from what one loves most in the world—that is where
everything ends; and yet, perhaps—”
</p>

<p>
Ethel did not answer, but remained with her head
resting on her hand. She understood quite well what
the duke wished to say. She looked aimlessly before her,
thinking of all that she had seen, of all these parade-rooms
and <i>chambres d’honneur</i>, and the gloomy stairways.
The gallery, adorned with portraits and suits of
heavy armor, haunted her. The donjons and courtyards,
the bastions and the moat and rusty drawbridge,—she
saw it all in her mind. In the old time, on festive days,
what a grand air it must all have had, with the heralds’
trumpets, with banqueting and tournaments, where fair
duchesses crowned those who vanquished! Or, again,
at the home-coming from the wars, when the Lady Knight
of Malta, Queen of Antioch, saluted with her sword the
torn banners! What a magnificent opportunity there
would be to bring this all back to sight, if she should
make Morgania live again with her millions! The castle
could be made the most princely abode in Europe. But
she wished to know more of Duke Conrad. She wished
to judge of him without being dazzled by his titles.
She was not to marry ancestors, but a husband whom she
might love!
</p>

<p class="caption">Visiting the Castle</p>
</div>

<p>
“Your castle is as big as a mountain,” she said to the
duke; “you go up and go down. I am now in full
training for my excursion to the Roman ruins, and to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_413' name='Page_413' href='#Page_413'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_414' name='Page_414' href='#Page_414'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_415' name='Page_415' href='#Page_415'>415</a></span>
that not less venerable ruin, the sorceress. When shall
we go, monseigneur?”
</p>

<p>
“Presently,” said the duke, as he pointed to packages
and luggage by the door of the hall. “But if I
were you, I would not go to Drina,” he added earnestly.
</p>

<p>
“Do you fear for the escort which accompanies us?”
said Ethel, with a smile.
</p>

<p>
“No; but if harm should come to you, what grief for
me!” replied the duke.
</p>

<p>
“Nothing will happen to us!” said Ethel. “And
then, can you imagine me going back to Chicago without
having had a single kodak-shot at brigands from nature?”
</p>

<p>
“I am unable to accompany you, and I regret it,”
said the duke. “I have to make an inspection of the
coast, and I ought also to receive a delegation of the
people.”
</p>

<p>
“We shall go alone,” said Ethel. “St. Morgana will
protect us.”
</p>

<p>
Something happened which greatly amused Ethel and
grandma; and the duke himself could not help smiling.
Adalbert broke off his play with Sœurette, and came
running to his father. He looked in turn at the Morgana
of the picture and at Helia, who was sitting near it.
The great canvas, illuminated by the stained-glass window,
harmonized splendidly with the hall. At the distance
where Ethel and the duke were placed, there was
nothing to hide the view of the painting. They saw
all its details, even the crowd which Phil had depicted
along the shore; it might have been the same crowd
which thronged the jetty the evening of the yacht’s arrival,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_416' name='Page_416' href='#Page_416'>416</a></span>
when the booming of the cannon drew the people
to the sea.
</p>

<p>
But the crowd in Phil’s picture was more animated
and gay. Instead of the gloom of discouragement, it
seemed transfigured by hope. It acclaimed the heroine;
Rhodaïs and Bertha and Thilda, with swords in their
hands, appeared amid the clouds. Everything in the
magnificent picture was strange and supernatural.
</p>

<p>
The child had just been struck by the resemblance between
the model and the portrait of Morgana; his astonishment
was touching, as he looked from one to the
other. He asked himself if the ancient legends were not
realized at last! if Morgana herself had not risen again
from the past, to be painted by Phil.
</p>

<p>
“My father,” said the child to the duke, “is it really
Morgana? Tell me!”
</p>

<p>
“What a child!” answered the duke, taking him in
his arms to kiss him. “He believes that Mlle. Helia
is Morgana.” And he looked at Ethel as if to say, “I
know full well who Morgana is—it is you!”
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_417' name='Page_417' href='#Page_417'>417</a></span>
</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h3>
CHAPTER V
<br />
VISITING THE SORCERESS
</h3>

<p>
The conveyance and escort for Ethel, with Suzanne
and Helia, were awaiting them at the other side
of the city. There were also horses for Will and
Phil. Sœurette was to remain behind, to keep company
with the little Monseigneur. Grandma returned to the
yacht, quite out of sympathy with living in old castles
which have plenty of stairways but no elevators.
</p>

<p>
Ethel had already seen the city; yet she had an ever
new pleasure in these comings and goings. Her inquisitiveness
was satisfied to the full. She was making studies
of a population as ignorant as it was unknown, anchored
to its old-time customs, and closed in by its mountains,
like monks within their cloisters. Yet beneath
all this torpor one could feel unconquerable pride and
love of vengeance and of glory.
</p>

<p>
These motionless shopkeepers would sell you a pair
of slippers or a whole outfit of pistols and daggers for
the belt. All these warlike accoutrements were amusements
to Ethel; she found them even on the porter who
peacefully brought her packages from the hall of the
throne to the carriage.
</p>

<p>
As soon as they had come down from the castle, after
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_418' name='Page_418' href='#Page_418'>418</a></span>
turning back a last time to salute the duke, whom etiquette
bound to the ramparts, along with Caracal, the
party entering the town seemed passing through a
haunt of brigands. Pieces of basket-work hung before
the shops. Suspended on nails in the shade were the
bridles of horses, shining with brass, and red leather
saddles, and swords. Savage eyes looked out to see
them go by.
</p>

<p>
The season for heavy siestas had passed. All the day
long the crowd thronged the street. Shepherds, clad in
hairy goatskins and shod with leather sandals, mingled
with soldiers, at whose side was slung long Albanian
rifles. They talked politics as they drank their coffee.
</p>

<p>
Others displayed the cylindric turban, the knit silken
girdle, and the dagger-sheath of brass. Women with
knit boots, and dressed in scarlet embroidered with
arabesques, sang to the accompaniment of the guzla—that
lyre with its single string made of twisted hair.
They droned out a psalmody of mountaineers, recalling
the ancient glories of their country.
</p>

<p>
Adalbert’s tutor, who accompanied the party, translated
and explained the songs.
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>The blood sprang to the cheeks of the impetuous queen;</p>
<p>Then every soldier satisfied his vengeance;</p>
<p class="i3">None like Morgana!</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p>Swift and daring she struck this one and pierced that one!</p>
<p>Ah, she poured out to her enemies a bitter drink!</p>
<p class="i3">Thus they all perished!</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>
Everywhere the impassioned looks and voices of the
crowd made them feel that war was near. All these
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_419' name='Page_419' href='#Page_419'>419</a></span>
peasants, coming from different regions, were stirred by
a common desire—to see the return of the heroic days
when Morgana and Rhodaïs and the great ancestresses
had led the people to victory.
</p>

<p>
Every one in the street drew aside as the party passed.
The rumor had run that a queen was to visit the duke—a
young maiden from unknown lands beyond the sea,
where the sun sets. Which one was it? Ethel or Helia?
Perhaps both? The people were in admiration at their
noble air. Women grown prematurely old in the harsh
labor of the fields were in ecstasy at their beauty. To
them the two young girls seemed of a higher race, like
that of the saints and heroines in the stained-glass windows
of their churches; they followed them with their
eyes, and took up again their chants in honor of Morgana.
</p>

<p>
Morgana was the universal inspiration; she was
everywhere. In the back of gloomy shops icons were
to be seen—St. Morgana, with the Virgin, dimly lighted
by a burning float. There was something touching in
the faith which this people had in their national legends.
</p>

<p>
Ethel appreciated the silence of the crowd on the
jetty that evening when the duke quitted the yacht.
No; his people did not recognize themselves in him.
They still had a certain respect for him, for the sake
of his glorious ancestors; but the people were prepared
to abandon him, and to take shelter in their dreams.
</p>

<p>
One would have said that the power of the state was
no longer in the ducal castle, but far away by the spurs
of the Kutsch-kom Mountain, where lived the sorceress,
the primitive oracle of her race. They paid no attention
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_420' name='Page_420' href='#Page_420'>420</a></span>
to their effeminate master, and listened only to this
ancestral voice, that foretold national happiness.
</p>

<p>
“Phil,” said Ethel, “you know the proverb, ‘When
you are in Rome, do as the Romans do.’ It’s a useless
recommendation, for we can’t help doing it. But even
if we don’t act like this people, we are rather Morganian
in our thoughts, are we not? And it is the women who
interest me chiefly,” Ethel continued. “It is their
heroines whose remembrance fills the people with a
hope beyond realization. And yet—what if it should
be realized? We can never be certain.”
</p>

<p>
Phil was silent,—Helia was at his side.
</p>

<p>
“You look a little tired,” Ethel said to her.
</p>

<p>
Phil took Helia’s arm; and they walked together, talking
little, making indifferent remarks to each other, each
alone with his own innermost thoughts. They were
leaving the weavers’ street for that of the armorers.
</p>

<p>
“There is enough here to cut the throats of a nation!”
Phil could not help observing.
</p>

<p>
They were between the lines of shops. The sun’s rays
fell straight down, striking flashes from the niello work
of the rifles, from the ivory of the Albanese pistols,
and from the clusters of daggers hanging from their
hooks. They were of every form and size: the Malay
creese, curved zigzag like a lightning-flash; Venetian
stilettos, as pointed as a bee’s sting; and others pierced
with holes, for their amalgam of arsenic and grease,
looking like blotches. Besides the slender, elegant blade
to be worn at the garter, there were horn-handled knives,
real bandits’ weapons, made to stick into the back.
</p>

<p class="caption">“‘Does the sight of so many weapons make you nervous?’”</p>
</div>

<p>
Phil thought of the landscape he had painted for
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_421' name='Page_421' href='#Page_421'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_422' name='Page_422' href='#Page_422'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_423' name='Page_423' href='#Page_423'>423</a></span>
Ethel when he had come from the circus, and of the
man who had sought for a knife in his pocket, threatening
Helia from a distance.
</p>

<p>
That very moment, as if some mysterious sympathy
had been set up between Helia and himself, he felt the
young girl’s arm tremble in his own. Helia pressed
against him in a movement of unreasoned fear.
</p>

<p>
“What is the matter, Helia?” he asked. “Does the
sight of so many weapons make you nervous?”
</p>

<p>
“No, it is not that,” said Helia, looking at the market-place
thronged with people.
</p>

<p>
“What are you looking at?” Phil insisted. “Has
any one frightened you? Do me the honor to fear nothing
when on my arm, Helia!”
</p>

<p>
“Oh! I am afraid of nothing,” answered Helia.
“Forgive me! it was surprise. I thought I saw some
one, recognized some one; but no, I must be crazy—”
</p>

<p>
“You have seen some one? Whom?”
</p>

<p>
Helia was on the point of answering, “Socrate!” but
she did not pronounce the name. Already he had been
spoken of too much between her and Phil. Besides, she
no longer could see the man. Yet she would have sworn
that but now, there, behind that group, she had beheld
the flat face of Socrate looking at her stealthily. It
must have been an illusion. Was she now going to meet
Socrate everywhere? Already, on board the yacht, one
evening when she was looking from the deck into the
boiler-room, she thought she had seen him in the red
rays of the fires with his eyes lifted toward her, shining
from a face black with coal-dust. Surely, it must
have been because, when they left Marseilles, Suzanne
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_424' name='Page_424' href='#Page_424'>424</a></span>
burst into laughter, saying: “See the stokers they are
taking on! There is one who looks like Socrate!”
</p>

<p>
“Do you wish me to find out?” Phil asked.
</p>

<p>
“No; remain here, Phil—here, at my side. It was just
an idea I had—but do not leave me,” she added, pressing
against him once more.
</p>

<p>
“A woman’s idea!” thought Phil. “I can understand
it, in this country where they sell daggers in clusters
as they sell bananas with us.”
</p>

<p>
The attention of both was drawn away by a change of
scene. They had left the city behind them and were
already in the open country. Peasants were driving
their mules or pushing carts, with children perched upon
bundles of straw and packs of rags. They were coming
to augment the tumult of those who had taken to
the city for refuge.
</p>

<p>
“It seems to me we are going the wrong way,” said
Ethel, laughing; “every one is turning his back to us.”
</p>

<p>
“Why, we’ve just started,” said Phil. “We must
go on now to the end.”
</p>

<p>
“Of course,” Ethel said, in delight; “and it’s so exciting!
I’d go through fire and flames to see something
really new. Come, here are our horses waiting
for us!”
</p>

<p>
“What luck!” cried Suzanne, “we are going to see
a sorceress—b-r-r-r-r! it sends a shiver down one’s back
to think of it!”
</p>

<p>
This childish outburst put everybody in good humor.
Will and Phil mounted their horses. Ethel, Helia, and
Suzanne seated themselves on the benches or the luggage
in the conveyance; and the escort started off.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_425' name='Page_425' href='#Page_425'>425</a></span>
</p>

<p>
They went straight into the mountains. Except the
guides and two soldiers in the picturesque costumes
of the klephts,—white gaiters and short jacket, like
that of a bull-fighter, with a fustanelle shirt,—no one
accompanied the tourists. The tutor had gone back to
Adalbert. There was no danger as far as the convent
of Semavat Evi, or “House of Heaven,” and there a
larger escort was awaiting them and would accompany
them to the frontier. Ethel asked herself in what condition
she would reach the place, so shockingly rough was
the road. Suzanne, seated on a valise which she named
her <i>strapontin</i> (an aisle-seat in a theater), was having
immense fun.
</p>

<p>
“It’s just like a scene in the Chatelet Theater,” she
said, pointing to the landscape where the huge castle
overlooked the old city huddled together at its feet, with
the yacht anchored out in the blue sea. She shook with
laughter as the wheel passed over a projecting rock
and all but overthrew the conveyance.
</p>

<p>
Ethel and Helia looked at the two soldiers marching
ahead. The flapping of their fustanelle skirts, when they
leaped over the gutters, gave them the air of two ballet-dancers.
The contrast between their brigand heads
and the collection of weapons at their belts, and their
long, white, agile legs was so comic that Ethel and
Helia did not perceive they were going along beside a
precipice. The cultivated land was passed, and they
could see only tufts of thorny shrubs. Suzanne alone
gave a note of gaiety to the bleak landscape. Ethel let
her talk on, without listening, and soon Suzanne was silent,
conquered like the others by the melancholy sight.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_426' name='Page_426' href='#Page_426'>426</a></span>
</p>

<p>
The horizon broadened around them, rising up on
either side. Below, the plains stretched out far as the
eye could reach. The road was like a thread lying
along the ground. By this road, at their feet, they
would come back from the excursion. Ethel looked
with interest at this pathway of so many invasions. The
rude mountaineers of Albania had followed it to the sea,
and more than once invaders had filled it with the flashing
of their swords. Who could know whether Morgania
was not to pass again through such a period of
disaster? There was now no living wall to stay the
waves.
</p>

<p>
The wagon went up and up in endless turnings. Suddenly,
as they crossed a plateau where ragged grass was
growing, a chant arose, monotonous and solemn, and
repeated by the echoes. On every side they seemed to
hear lamentations and groans issuing forth from the
earth or falling from the clouds.
</p>

<p>
“Where are we?” asked Ethel, stirred from her reverie.
“I see no one.”
</p>

<p>
“It is the shepherds over there,” said Helia.
</p>

<p>
Ethel perceived, in the midst of a lean flock, beside
a fire whose smoke mounted straight upward, a group
of shepherds singing. It was one of the <i>prismés</i> which
they sing from one mountain to the other. Ethel was
greatly impressed by these spontaneous chants of the
desert. In them, hoarse cries alternated with sharp,
high cadences and a quickening measure. An impression
of grandeur was left behind by this singing in the
solitude. Ethel thought with pity of the old untuned
piano in the castle, and of the sound of the banjo, thin
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_427' name='Page_427' href='#Page_427'>427</a></span>
as the humming of flies among the massive pillars of
the throne-room. The castle itself,—what was it compared
with these huge natural towers overlooking the
road, with their giant steps made of rocks that had slid
down?—or to these ravines, like somber courtyards,—to
these measureless caverns opening like vaults, in the
depths of which the schist rock shone like stained-glass
windows? And still they mounted up, turning around
these strongholds of a country made for liberty. They
were approaching the grotto of the sorceress.
</p>

<p>
A joyful burst of laughter drew Ethel from her reverie.
Behind her, seated astride a package, Suzanne was
in an ecstasy of delight.
</p>

<p>
“The ballet!—oh, Miss Rowrer, the ballet is beginning—look
at the <i>danseuses</i>!”
</p>

<p>
Suzanne was choking, stuffing her handkerchief into
her mouth not to let herself be heard.
</p>

<p>
The two soldiers, won by the music’s enthusiasm, were
leaping in time with sharp cries, now squatting to
earth and now brandishing their rifles, swaying right
and left, and twirling their legs while their fustanella
skirts stood out straight. Like monkeys drunk with
cocoa-milk, they gave inarticulate cries—“Yoo! yoo!”
</p>

<p>
“Encore!” cried Suzanne.
</p>

<p>
“My kodak!” said Ethel.
</p>

<p>
“I’m sitting on it!” said Suzanne; “I can hear it
crack!”
</p>

<p>
All their gaiety had come back. Ethel felt the need
of shaking off the mysterious influence that had been
depressing her since they set out.
</p>

<p>
“Really, I’m too simple,” she said; “I shall wind up
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_428' name='Page_428' href='#Page_428'>428</a></span>
by believing in their sorceress. Poor old woman, who
will sell us four-leaved clover against thunder, coral
horns against the evil eye, fetishes and prayer-mills and
garlic <i>pommade</i>.”
</p>

<p>
“How happy Poufaille would be here!” thought Suzanne.
</p>

<p>
“What a journey!” Ethel continued. “What roads!
I am all shaken up! At least they ought to build a
narrow-gage railroad in such a country!” she said to
Will, who had come up with her.
</p>

<p>
“It wouldn’t pay,” said Will. “But if I owned these
mountains I’d take the ore out of them.”
</p>

<p>
“Mademoiselle would be very good if she would ask
for me a toad’s-hair chaplet,” Suzanne said, in a low
tone.
</p>

<p>
“Ask? From whom? From my brother?”
</p>

<p>
“No! From the old sorceress!”
</p>

<p>
“But toads haven’t hair, Suzanne!”
</p>

<p>
“It was M. Caracal told me.”
</p>

<p>
“Oh, if you’re going to believe all that he says—”
</p>

<p>
“Poor old woman!” observed Will, “living in
such a hole, stuck to her rock like an oyster in its
shell!”
</p>

<p>
“That doesn’t prevent her consulting the stars and
occupying herself with Jupiter, and knowing a hundred
and ten ways of foretelling the future.”
</p>

<p>
“A hundred and ten ways—that’s a great deal,” replied
Will. “Which is the best of them all?”
</p>

<p>
“Let’s count on our fingers,” said Ethel. “I’ll
begin. Aëromancy, by the air; aleuromancy, by flour;
telomancy, by arrows—”
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_429' name='Page_429' href='#Page_429'>429</a></span>
</p>

<p>
“—Dactylomancy, by the fingers; chiromancy, by the
hand; podomancy, by the feet!” continued Phil.
</p>

<p>
“Hydromancy, by water,” Ethel began again.
“Rhabdomancy, by sticks—”
</p>

<p>
“That’s for Poufaille,” thought Suzanne. “<i>Vive
la rhabdomancie!</i>”
</p>

<p>
Just then the horses stopped, and the driver turned
to the tourists, saying a few words in a low tone of
voice and pointing with his finger to a recess in the
rock. They had reached their journey’s end. All was
silent. Ethel, Helia, and Suzanne descended from the
vehicle, and Will and Phil leaped from their horses.
</p>

<p>
The spot was a wild one. Before them the whole
country lay outstretched. Behind them mountains were
heaped together. The wind blew, tossing the horses’
manes; and the great passing clouds seemed to issue
forth from the mountain.
</p>

<p>
The visitors took a few steps forward and saw a
black hole. It was the cavern. A rough statue of Morgana,
virgin and martyr, was carved in the living rock.
There were heaps of votive offerings around it—little
figures of children and birds, veils and women’s girdles,
daggers and flowers and fruits, and the red cake which
betrothed ones break before marriage. A peasant woman
at her prayers, prostrate on the rock at the saint’s
feet, was praying with the energy of despair, and calling
for vengeance.
</p>

<p>
The visitors kept on advancing, half regretting that
they had come. What were they to say to the sorceress?
Ethel, greatly moved, took Phil’s arm. It seemed to her
that her own lot was to be decided. She felt her heart
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_430' name='Page_430' href='#Page_430'>430</a></span>
beating as they advanced to the grotto. Helia was at
her side. Will was behind with Suzanne. They came
to the opening and leaned forward, but saw nothing.
</p>

<p>
Little by little their eyes grew accustomed to the darkness.
They could distinguish, uncertainly, in the depths,
eyes that shone—and then a figure, huddled together
on a bed of rushes, looking at them, motionless, with her
finger to her mouth, like a statue of silence! The eyes,
fixed in turn on each of them, suddenly rested upon
Helia with a strange glow.
</p>

<p>
“Oh, how she looks at me!” Helia said, seizing Ethel’s
arm. “Oh, <i>mon Dieu</i>, if she only will not speak! Let
us go away; I entreat you, let us go away! I am
afraid!”
</p>

<p>
They started back, and felt relieved when they were
out of sight of the sinister eyes.
</p>

<p>
“Let us go,” said Ethel.
</p>

<p>
At the feet of St. Morgana, the suppliant one was now
praying as in an ecstasy.

MISS ETHEL ROWRER TO MLLE. DE GROJEAN
</p>

<p class="letter_head">
“On board the <i>Columbia</i>.</p>

<p>
“You’ll have to hang yourself, my valorous
Yvonne, for we have had our battle without you!
The truth is, we have narrowly escaped being
spitted and roasted. That’s a promising beginning,
isn’t it? Grand’mère will be delighted that you were
not there; but you will regret it if you read my letter to
the end. I say ‘if,’ for it’s a whole history. Excuse my
writing feverishly, on the gallop; I am in a hurry to tell
you. I promised you an adventure in Morgania—and
here is one. Only I am not its heroine, alas! For it is a
story of heroism, and that of the purest. As for me,
I feel the need of crying aloud my admiration for that
noble young girl. Are you curious? It is Helia; you
understand—Helia! You remember her? She was one
of those who ‘don’t count’!
</p>

<p>
“I come to the facts.
</p>

<p>
“We have left Semavat Eli—a Heavenly House,
wherein we were eaten up by vermin, and served by
good monks who amused themselves teaching thrushes
to whistle. The next day, from early morning, as
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_432' name='Page_432' href='#Page_432'>432</a></span>
soon as they had let us down,—by the window, if you
please, in great wicker baskets (for in this country
monasteries have no doors),—Suzanne seated herself on
my kodak, Helia and I on our valises, Will and Phil
straddled their horses, and—forward, march! over
pointed rocks to Thermopylæ! that is, to their Thermopylæ,
which is the defile of the Moratscha. It was
a kind of pilgrimage we were doing—five in all, not
counting our escort of ballet-dancers, who were waiting
for us at the monastery. By that, I mean soldiers
with fustanelle skirts, armed to the teeth, very white
teeth in black faces, quite like wolves!
</p>

<p>
“The evening before we’d climbed up all the way to
see the sorceress—I ought to say the prophetess, and
you must not laugh, I entreat you, for it would give me
pain. I was never so affected in my life. From that
place to Semavat Eli the country is flat, except for the
horrible road. After that, we had to go down and down
to the defile along the river Drina. We crossed impetuous
torrents where there was not enough water for
a water-color sketch, and forests dry as firewood, all
bristling with thorns, so that we could not go near without
leaving bits of our gowns. It was the abomination
of desolation,—and down we came, down and down toward
the plain; and through the plain we came back.
For that matter there is nothing to see but ill-cultivated
fields and dilapidated houses.
</p>

<p>
“It is a country where there are no locks. The duke
told me so, to give me an idea of his people’s honesty.
Suzanne, who is an amusing child, says that doors without
locks are the invention of poor countries; and that
there are no thieves where there is nothing to steal.

</p>

<p>
“At noon we stopped. We ate and rested, and our
soldiers sang and danced; and then we were off again.
There were more impetuous watercourses of gravel and
pebble. There were shepherds watching their goats,
and red-haired women carrying burdens on their heads,
and looking at us with wide-open mouths. We were
near the spot.
</p>

<p>
“Imagine a wild gorge. It was the meeting of two
ways, from the mountain and from the plain. Farther
along was the river Drina, with its old bridge. That
is the end of Morgania, which is protected by its mountains,
with this defile, like Thermopylæ, as its only entrance.
But, you will ask me, what about Helia?
</p>

<p>
“Patience!
</p>

<p>
“We had all got down, leaving the horses and wagons
in the shade of the defile. I had a fixed idea that I
would go to the middle of the frontier bridge, which
belongs half to Christ and half to Mohammed, and that I
would also visit the Roman ruin and the little Christian
village farther on, which has a little belfry like a minaret.
</p>

<p>
“But as we drew near there were loud cries, and a
headlong flight of peasants, their features distorted with
fright as they ran past us. Then there was the fire and
smoke of a fusillade, the tocsin sounding, and then more
cries,—frightful cries,—the howling of hunted beasts,
piercing the ear like a knife.
</p>

<p>
“It was all so sudden that we didn’t know what to
do. We all spoke at once: ‘What is it?’ ‘What shall
we do?’ ‘Shall we defend ourselves?’ ‘The soldiers!’
</p>

<p>
“There were no soldiers—fled—out of sight! We
could barely see their white ballet-skirts leaping away
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_436' name='Page_436' href='#Page_436'>436</a></span>
in every direction. We were going to have our throats
cut like sheep! I remember how at that moment the
frightened crowd rushed upon the bridge, and bore us
back with it toward the defile. Phil grasped my arm
and said to Helia and me: ‘Don’t be afraid; I’m with
you!’ There was such fire in his eyes that I felt reassured.
We went back toward the wagon, and I shut
my eyes and stuffed my fingers in my ears, letting pass
the waves of howling creatures,—men, women, and children,—who
climbed up on the wagon or slipped beneath
it, some leaping up only to fall back with convulsed
features, struck down by the bullets!
</p>

<p>
“I heard Will say to me, ‘Turks!’ I opened my eyes.
Horsemen were riding here and there through the plain,
striking right and left with their sabers. Men on foot
were advancing, singing harshly. I heard a general discharge,
and then pitiful cries. The wagon turned crosswise
of the defile. One of our horses reared and the
other fell heavily; all the luggage tumbled—the way
was blocked! We were sheltered by the wagon as behind
a barricade, pell-mell with the fugitives. Helia had not
followed us—she was not there!
</p>

<p>
“‘Helia is lost!’ Phil said to me. Pressed by the
crowd as he was, he could not disengage himself to go
to her aid. Through an opening in the wagon I saw her
standing alone. She had not had time to take shelter
with us. Bullets were whistling on every side. I no
longer knew what I was doing. These were not comic-opera
Turks, with gourds for helmets, and dressed in
gilded rags. They were men armed with rifles and
daggers. Everywhere there were the dead, everywhere
there was blood. It was frightful!
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_437' name='Page_437' href='#Page_437'>437</a></span>
</p>

<p>
“The bullets became fewer—the enemy had taken to
their swords, and we were without arms, pressed upon
by the crowd which clung to our garments.
</p>

<p>
“Oh, never shall I forget what I then saw. Helia,
as I have said, was alone, facing our assailants. There
she remained! She had snatched from one of the fugitives
an enormous club. The enemy drew near. A
Turk came upon her and was already stretching out his
hand to seize her by the hair, when Helia whirled the
club, bringing it down on the man and splitting his skull!
He fell and Helia put her foot on him.
</p>

<p>
“As the man was falling Helia seized his rifle and
put it quickly to her shoulder. We heard two reports,
and two more of the enemy went down.
</p>

<p>
“All this passed in no time at all. Helia seemed like
a supernatural being. As she remained standing upright,
the attack wavered. The Turks were terror-stricken
at this young maiden whose throat they had
expected to cut as they passed by, and who handled these
heavy weapons as if she were playing with them. I
heard Helia call to us; but we could not stir. I wept
with rage. How I wished to be beside her! She whirled
the rifle by the end of its barrel; and with a terrific blow
brought down the breech on the head of one who seemed
the leader. They fell back for a moment. Meanwhile we
did not remain idle; and the peasants had pulled themselves
together. Phil and I, as soon as we had got ourselves
loose, jumped on the wagon, after picking up rifles.
Will brought back the soldiers; and when the Turks, mad
with rage, and sword in hand, came rushing back upon
Helia—who awaited them without flinching—they were
welcomed with a discharge of bullets which stopped them
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_438' name='Page_438' href='#Page_438'>438</a></span>
short. Our fears were over. The Turks fled, our bullets
striking them in their backs, and the peasants pursuing
them with sticks and stones. In a moment the bridge
was free. Phil had not quitted me for an instant. He
was always between me and the enemy, and superbly
cool. I asked him, ‘What is the matter with Helia? She
seems to be looking for death!’ It is certain there was
something like despair in her terrible intrepidity. Phil
did not answer. He seemed more moved than herself.
Just then I had no time to go into the question; all of
us were safe and sound; that was the main thing. The
Turks had fled away, and would not soon return. We
gathered up the wounded. Suzanne was everywhere at
once, with a bottle in her hand. ‘<i>Qui veut la goutte, les
enfants? Voilà la petite cantinière!</i>’ [‘Who wants a
drink, children? Here’s the cantinière!’] The bells of
the Christian village rang joyously, and the cry was taken
up, and grew louder and louder: ‘Morgana! Morgana!’
Helia was borne in triumph. Women knelt down as she
passed. The brave girl was bleeding a little; and they
gathered the drops of blood on pieces torn from her gown,
like the relics of a saint. For me, I was happy beyond
expression. I kissed her cheeks and cried: ‘Morgana!’
</p>

<p>
“‘What! you, too, Miss Ethel! But I have done
nothing!’ answered Helia. ‘I did my part, that was
all.’

<p>
“Wagons came from the village, and we put the
wounded into them. One who spoke Italian told us the
story. The Albanian Moslems for a long time had been
threatening the Christians. They demanded a thousand
Turkish pounds. They were refused, and raided the

village on the day of a marriage, when every one was at
the feast. They were going to invade the district of
Morgania where the victims were taking refuge; but this
young girl had saved everything!
</p>

<p>
“Helia had her gown all torn, and so they threw over
her shoulders the mantle of the village bride. Upon her
disheveled hair they placed the red symbolic head-dress,
with its golden tassels.
</p>

<p>
“Helia’s cart was at the head of the convoy, and
the other wagons followed, filled with the wounded.
Phil galloped along on an Albanian horse with red-and-white
trappings. Will remained in the village, to organize
the resistance. I went back to the city with Suzanne,
on Helia’s cart.
</p>

<p>
“It was a triumphal march. All these poor people
and ourselves, whom she had saved from massacre, had
eyes only for her. But she had no air of happiness!
She had a slight wound in the forehead. From time to
time a drop of blood fell on her gown and made a red
stain. This streak of blood marked her out to the crowd.
The cheers redoubled, and little children threw kisses
toward her. She was indifferent to it all, and looked
only at the little red stain.
</p>

<p>
“‘Oh, my pretty gown,’ she said, ‘my pretty bridal
gown is ruined!’
</p>

<p>
“The road through the valley is much shorter than
that over the mountain. We were to get to the city
by night, just before day-dawn. Oh, what a vision,
never to be forgotten, was that night journey! You
cannot believe how quickly the tidings traveled, in this
country without telegraphs or railroad. Horsemen went
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_442' name='Page_442' href='#Page_442'>442</a></span>
galloping before us. When we passed through a village
there were cries of joy and men dancing by the light
of torches. Priests bearing golden crosses blessed us as
we passed. Helia’s exploits grew from mouth to mouth,
and this explained the ever-increasing enthusiasm. She
had killed eight enemies with her own hand, had stopped
the invasion and saved the convoy from massacre! At
Gradiska she had killed twenty, and at Kolo more still.
</p>

<p>
“‘You will see,’ Helia said to me; ‘by the time we
get to the city I shall have killed the Grand Vizir and
the Sultan!’
</p>

<p>
“Our escort kept on growing. It was grand when we
entered the city. Helia had been hoping to find every
one asleep. You would have thought you were going
into a bee-hive! They wished to carry Helia in triumph
to the castle. But the duke was not there—he
was off on the excursion along the coast. The people
will never pardon him for not having been present to
share their joy and cheer the heroine.
</p>

<p>
“To wind up: I don’t know how we did it, but we
got back to the yacht all the same, broken and bruised
and delighted, deafened by the cries, and blinded by the
lights.
</p>

<p>
“Every one is resting except myself. I cannot stay
quiet, and I profit by my sleeplessness to write you.
Well, what did I tell you? Are you not sorry to have
missed a thing like that? And I will have other things
to tell you when I have the pleasure to see you again,
my dear Yvonne....
</p>

<p>
“P.S. The heavens are mixing themselves up in
the event. You have heard of the Fata Morgana—that
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_443' name='Page_443' href='#Page_443'>443</a></span>
wonderful mirage effect along the coast of the Adriatic
(it comes from the evaporation of hot air in the lower
layers, changing refraction to reflection, and so forth,
and so forth; but people here simply attribute it to a
fairy’s enchantments).
</p>

<p>
“However that may be, I am finishing this letter just
as the sun is rising, and the sky is marvelous. I am
looking at great streaks of blood and crumbling towers
and golden crowns—all changing form every moment.
You can see in it what you wish; but, always, it is
beautiful.”

<h3>
CHAPTER VII
<br />
THE FATEFUL DAY BEGINS
</h3>

<p>
Ethel finished her letter, and went up on deck to
find grandma. A splendid day was appearing,
with its marvelous light flooding space. Morgana
was building her palaces in the heavenly azure. Golden
darts across battlemented clouds were driving away the
birds of night. The sun rose up, enormous in size. In
front of the yacht the city, with its minarets and domes,
showed like a vision of the Orient. The castle, scarcely
outlined, seemed floating above the waters.
</p>

<p>
“Brave Helia! the heavens are celebrating her—how
splendid the mirage is, grandma!” said Ethel.
</p>

<p>
“You see, Ethel,” Mrs. Rowrer remarked, “mirages
are not easily appreciated with glasses. At my age
I perceive rather the chill of the mist.”
</p>

<p>
“My dear grandma!” said Ethel, as she kissed her,
“don’t you think that what Helia did was simply
grand? Even with your glasses you can distinguish
heroism. Helia is what I call a woman! When I
think that I might have done it—what would I not give
to be in her place, grandma!”
</p>

<p>
“Are you jealous, Ethel?”
</p>

<p>
“Oh, grandma!”
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_445' name='Page_445' href='#Page_445'>445</a></span>
</p>

<p>
No; Ethel was not jealous. But for the last few days
nothing had gone well with her. She was not like Helia,
who had so many reasons to be joyful—and who yet
was sad. Ethel had genuine cares. First, she had
not risen to the mark like Helia; next—and oh, what
a grudge she had against Will for it!—when she saw
the poor refugees without food or shelter, she remarked
to her brother how much wretchedness there
was to comfort, that something ought to be done.
It would even be an acknowledgment of the duke’s
hospitality.
</p>

<p>
“It’s already done!” was Will’s answer. “I cabled
from the city yesterday; one of our freight steamers will
quit Odessa at once with grain and food.”
</p>

<p>
“There I am!” Ethel said, in comic despair.
</p>

<p>
Ethel looked far off at the city and castle, for the
yacht had taken to the open on account of drifting currents.
She was thinking of Morgania. The manner in
which the duke would understand his duty under the
present circumstances would be a standard by which to
judge the man.
</p>

<p>
That the duke had stayed on in Paris when he ought
to have been in Morgania—that she could willingly forgive,
since it was for her that he stayed. But that now
he should be brave, loyal to his people, with a burning
zeal for progress and all that is good—that would be
more pleasing to her than all his attentions.
</p>

<p>
“What is the matter, grandma? You have something
on your mind,” said Ethel to her grandmother,
who was looking toward the mountains.
</p>

<p>
“It is nothing,” said grandma. “I was thinking of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_446' name='Page_446' href='#Page_446'>446</a></span>
Will, who is over there, and fearing some accident might
happen to him.”
</p>

<p>
“Just now he risks nothing,” said Ethel. “It is all
enthusiasm among the people. Will is to take the
most pressing measures. The enemy is sure to return,
but the duke will be ready—unless he wastes too much
time.”
</p>

<p>
They heard the stroke of oars, and a small boat came
alongside.
</p>

<p>
“I’m sure it’s the duke coming to congratulate us,”
said Ethel. “He must have returned—and you’ll see,
grandma, he will thank me for saving Morgania, and
will put his heart at my feet! He will say the people
wish me, that they are crying for me! Watch him,
grandma, when I tell him that it is not I, it is Helia!
You’ll see his expression: ‘Helia! hum—hum—charming,
very charming, but, really—’”
</p>

<p>
“You judge the duke wrongly, Ethel.”
</p>

<p>
“She’s right, all the same!” thought Suzanne.
</p>

<p>
“The duke knows what he’s about, grandma! But
it is not he,” she said, looking over at the boat. “They
are two—in long coats! That’s not local color.”
</p>

<p>
“They are my two bears—Zrnitschka, Bjelopawlitji!
<i>Sauve qui peut!</i>” Suzanne muttered to herself.
</p>

<p>
It was, indeed, the two delegates. They had been
chosen because they were accustomed to diplomatic missions;
and, moreover, they spoke French.
</p>

<p>
They came up—bent themselves double.
</p>

<p>
They presented the duke’s excuses. “Monseigneur was
unable to come—he was presiding at the Assembly of
Notables with Monseigneur Adalbert.”
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_447' name='Page_447' href='#Page_447'>447</a></span>
</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p class="caption">The Delegates</p>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_448' name='Page_448' href='#Page_448'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_449' name='Page_449' href='#Page_449'>449</a></span>
</p>

<p>
“Ah, by the way,” said grandma, “how is the little
fellow? and Sœurette?”
</p>

<p>
“Monseigneur Adalbert is well—and the little girl also.
They’re playing together on the terrace all the time.”
</p>

<p>
Then the delegates explained their mission. They had
come to invite the heroine to land in the evening. The
people were preparing a monster welcome for her. Immense
crowds were coming in from all parts. Nothing
like it had been seen in the memory of man. Monseigneur,
the duke, would remain to give orders, that all
might be worthy of the expected guest. The duke begged
Miss Rowrer to be present with him afterward at the
reception in the throne-room—and he laid his heart at
her feet.
</p>

<p>
“There—just as I thought!” was Ethel’s reflection.
“The duke believes it was I!”
</p>

<p>
Ethel turned to Suzanne: “Ask Mlle. Helia—or,
rather, no! it’s useless to ask her; she would not come—I
know her! But she will not refuse it to me as a service,”
she argued within herself, “we will go together,
with Helia at the head. She shall have her triumph this
evening.”
</p>

<p>
Suzanne showed signs of trouble. The delegates had
recognized her and bowed low. The name “Helia”
struck them. It came back with the memories of their
strange diplomatic soirée.
</p>

<p>
“What is the matter?” Ethel asked Suzanne, sharply.
“Do you know them?”
</p>

<p>
“No—that is—yes!” answered Suzanne.
</p>

<p>
“Really, is it yes or no?”
</p>

<p>
“<i>Eh bien</i>, yes.”
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_450' name='Page_450' href='#Page_450'>450</a></span>
</p>

<p>
“Where did you see them? At Paris?—at the duke’s
place?”
</p>

<p>
“At the duke’s—yes—that is—no! It was one evening
when Mademoiselle Helia—”
</p>

<p>
“Do they know Helia?”
</p>

<p>
“No!—or, rather—”
</p>

<p>
“Or rather yes?” interrupted Ethel.
</p>

<p>
“I am trying to tell you—”
</p>

<p>
“Good—you’ll tell me later.”
</p>

<p>
The delegates thought they were talking of the evening
reception.
</p>

<p>
“Messieurs,” Ethel said to them, “it is understood.
Thank the duke—I shall be there at the appointed
hour.”
</p>

<p>
The delegates bowed, and Ethel accompanied them to
the rail.
</p>

<p>
“Be careful not to fall, M. Zrnitschka, M. Bjelopawlitji!
See, messieurs,” she added, pointing to a tarpaulin
which they were arranging at the yacht’s side, “that is a
bath-room—it’s a tropical invention. The tarpaulin is
held by bars stretched out on the top of the water and
making a rigid square. It’s a genuine bath-tub, five
meters long and wide, and four feet deep. That does not
prevent me from jumping over it when I wish, and I take
a little turn in the open. That is the real bath-tub for
me!” And she pointed to the sea.
</p>

<p>
Ethel could not keep her face straight at the frightened
look of the delegates, who kept on bowing and bowing
as they clambered down the steps.
</p>

<p>
“What ought I to say?” Suzanne was thinking within
herself. She would have to tell all the stories about the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_451' name='Page_451' href='#Page_451'>451</a></span>
duke and Helia, and perhaps about Phil,—“and I who
don’t know how to lie!”
</p>

<p>
Ethel quietly took her seat by grandma, without speaking
to Suzanne of anything at all.
</p>

<p>
“It’s Helia’s day,” she thought. “It would be bad
taste to crush the brave young girl with my dresses
when she has only simple things.”
</p>

<p>
“Very well, Suzanne,” Ethel said aloud. “I do not
need you for the present. See that everything is ready
for this evening—a simple street-gown.”
</p>

<p>
Ethel’s curiosity, however, had been excited. What
could there have been in common between the duke and
Helia and Suzanne? She now remembered a few passing
words. Caracal had finally told her his story of the
Louvre gardener, and Adam and Eve. She recalled his
expressions. Phil never spoke to her of Helia, although
he recounted willingly the adventures of his youth.
Against this were his occasional embarrassment, certain
hidden allusions, and his salon portrait of the young girl
in the midst of flowers surrounded by a flight of doves;
and then, why should Phil, only yesterday, have dropped
his eyes and blushed at the mad bravery of Helia? Did
he, then, know the secret of it?
</p>

<p>
It was not pleasant to Ethel to go into such questions.
Helia’s melancholy, and her daring, her seeking
for death when she was only twenty—it was not natural!
Miss Rowrer did not need to know more. She understood
all, so she believed.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_452' name='Page_452' href='#Page_452'>452</a></span>
</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h3>
CHAPTER VIII
<br />
FATA MORGANA TO THE RESCUE!
</h3>

<p>
Later in the day Suzanne appeared, and timidly
begged Miss Rowrer to excuse her. “Mademoiselle
Helia has gone from the tarpaulin—she is swimming
straight for the cliff. If Miss Rowrer would be good
enough to go on deck, perhaps Mademoiselle Helia—” As
for her, Suzanne, she could do nothing—she had called in
vain.
</p>

<p>
Miss Rowrer followed Suzanne, but Helia was already
far away.
</p>

<p>
“She would not listen to me,” said Suzanne. “I don’t
know what came over her.”
</p>

<p>
“But where is she going?”
</p>

<p>
“To the rocks off there, Miss Rowrer.”
</p>

<p>
Suzanne pointed to the shoals on which the sea was
breaking.
</p>

<p>
“Well,” Ethel said, to quiet Suzanne, “Helia is not
lost. If I had been on the deck I would have asked her
not to do it. But one who swims as she does has nothing
to fear. I only hope she won’t delay, so as to be back in
time for the evening’s reception.”
</p>

<p>
“If only she comes back!”
</p>

<p>
“Oh, now! it’s only child’s play for her,” said Miss
Rowrer, following with her glass Helia’s movements.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_453' name='Page_453' href='#Page_453'>453</a></span>
</p>

<p>
For any one else than Helia the undertaking would
have been hazardous, because of the eddies among the
rocks. She might also hit against some point just hidden
beneath the water. There was a striking contrast between
the immense cliff and the almost imperceptible
swimmer, who was going farther and farther away.
</p>

<p>
The marvelous sky had become more magnificent still.
The sea was resplendent, and now and then a luminous
wake showed behind Helia; and then it would suddenly
be quenched in the blackness of the shoal water.
</p>

<p>
“How little Helia seems in all that immensity!” Ethel
said to Phil, who had joined her.
</p>

<p>
“She has reached the rocks—she is going up them,”
said Phil.
</p>

<p>
“Oh! never fear for her; I understand what urges her
on: it is still that love of danger which made her heroic
yesterday. Have no fear for Helia,” Ethel said to Suzanne,
as she gave her the glass. “If I thought there
was the least danger, I would send out the boat; but I
think she—she wishes to be alone; we will respect her
desire.”
</p>

<p>
That day Ethel had a thousand things to do: letters
to write; her preparations for the evening; to choose the
music which was to be played on board during the reception
on land. Especially there was an old-time
melody which she had heard Helia singing in a low voice
in her cabin. Ethel had a muffled rehearsal of it in the
forecastle. She wished to keep it as a surprise for Helia
in the evening, when she should enter the throne-room.
She counted greatly on the effect; the music would come
in waves mingled with the sea-breeze, filling the night
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_454' name='Page_454' href='#Page_454'>454</a></span>
with harmony and encircling Helia with her favorite
melody. There were also flowers to bring and other
orders to give.
</p>

<p>
While they were thus making ready her triumph,
Helia, who was now stretched out on the seaweed amid
the rocks, dreamed, with her mind far away. The effort
she had made and the coolness of the water had calmed
her. The ardent light shone on her damp neck and arms
as on rose-colored marble. The wet bathing-dress clung
to her round limbs, and her heavy hair rolled over her
shoulders. She was like a dreaming Naiad clinging to the
sharp rocks above a sunken Atlantis.
</p>

<p>
All around her the sky heaped up tumultuous splendor.
Fata Morgana was disporting herself in the burning
mists.
</p>

<p>
Helia looked at the glowing apotheosis so far above
her, as inaccessible as her dream. Then her eyes fell
to the craggy ruins so much more in harmony with her
thoughts. The green light upon the sea was reflected
in her clear eyes. Beneath the transparent waters she
could perceive a strange vegetation gently waving its
leaves. Ah, how well one might rest down there, lying
on the golden sands amid flowers which seemed alive!
</p>

<p>
Suddenly Helia blushed for herself—no! away with
the ugly thought! All her pride revolted against it.
Really, she was going mad! This idle, artificial life had
been gnawing at her ever since she had come on the
yacht. What was she doing with these happy ones of the
earth, in the midst of their luxury? She saw clearly
that Phil and Miss Rowrer were made for each other.
No, she would not go to America to be exposed to such
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_455' name='Page_455' href='#Page_455'>455</a></span>
continual torture as the sight of their love would be—to
see Phil living serenely on, without remorse and without
regret. She must escape as soon as possible from
him, and go back to her dressing-room, smelling of patchouli,
and adorned with its broken mirror. There, at
least, she would feel at home!
</p>

<p>
Helia, with her eyes fixed upon the sea, was building
a hundred schemes. First of all, one thing was certain.
She would now dare to attempt feats which she had
never done before—which no one had ever done before.
She might break her neck—well, it would be dying on
the field of honor!
</p>

<p>
Her success should be dazzling. She would conquer
New York, London, and Berlin. They would cover her
with flowers, which she would crush beneath her feet
as she retired behind the scenes. She would turn her
back on the hall thundering with bravos, and would
answer to her calls not by a flip-flap entrance like some
peasant mountebank! No, she would find some unheard-of
feat to make the hall grow pale with fright.
Ah! she was not good for love; they would see what
she was worth for terror!
</p>

<p>
Her brain went on inventing exercises and seeing
movements, composing sensational numbers. She would
have all the managers at her feet—Barrasford, in
England, and Krokowski, in St. Petersburg. At Moscow
the Boyards should offer her diamonds, and she
would throw them back into their faces! She would be
an artiste, only an artiste, the greatest artiste of all
time! She would not be of those who are afraid to
spoil their beauty or tear their maillots at the trapeze.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_456' name='Page_456' href='#Page_456'>456</a></span>
She would have the number preceded by orchestral silences,
suddenly breaking like a thunder-storm. She
alone would do more than all the others, more than the
Alexes and the Hanlons, more than fifty Leamy sisters.
And on the tight-rope she would do more than the
Omers, on her hands more than Bartholdi, on the carpet
more than the Kremos or Scheffers! She could see
herself, to the roaring of the band, with the crowd beneath
her feet—the crowd of lying mouths, of soft and
cowardly hearts; and she would cast at them a look of
scorn while taking her flight to the roof.
</p>

<p>
She would have posters on all the walls in the least
village town—a Gymnast, in England; a Gymnasiarque,
in France; in Germany, a Bravourturnerin,—great
posters to dazzle the Ochsenmaulsalatsfabrikanten!
That would be fortune and glory! Oh, what a dog’s
life! How could a man like Phil live with falsehood in
his heart, and never a word of excuse? She would have
given him up, she would have understood! She was
not made for him; so be it. Phil could not give Miss
Rowrer a rival like Helia—no! He had only to ask her
pardon to obtain it—a kind word, and a kiss, and
good-by. But no! there was not even that. Ah, Phil,
Phil; he did not even take the trouble to give her back
her word!

<p class="caption">“‘Help me!’ he cried”</p>
</div>

<p>
Helia’s fever had passed, and her dreams were calmed.
She felt herself very lowly and little, crushed at the
foot of the cliff—herself like a bit of jetsam amid the
broken fragments of the rock. She dipped her hand in
the water and amused herself by letting it run out between
her fingers in a shining shower. Or, again, she

<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_458' name='Page_458' href='#Page_458'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_459' name='Page_459' href='#Page_459'>459</a></span>
plunged her arms to the bottom, tearing up the sea-flowers,
the dainty algæ, and placing them in her hair,
mingling them with the unbound tresses. Then she
bent over, to look at herself in the water, like a child.
</p>

<p>
“I am really like the Morgana in Phil’s picture,” she
thought.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, even in the little creek where Helia was
looking at herself, the water had grown less calm, and
a current was rushing out to the open sea. Helia stood,
stretched her limbs, and looked at the yacht.
</p>

<p>
“Come!” she said to herself, “<i>en route!</i> It is time
to go!”
</p>

<p>
She was just taking her spring when she stopped
short, listening. Uncertain cries were borne in to her
on the breeze. They came from the shore. All that part
of the bay, and the castle itself, were hidden from her by
a wall of cliffs.
</p>

<p>
“What can be the matter?” she asked herself. “Are
those cries of distress?”
</p>

<p>
Just then, a little boat with a child for its sole passenger
floated out before her, amid the shoals, borne on
by the ebbing current.
</p>

<p>
The child had let drop the oars. He was holding
with both hands to the boat’s gunwale and looking out
to sea with his eyes dilated with fear.
</p>

<p>
“Help me!” he cried.
</p>

<p>
It was the little Duke Adalbert.
</p>

<p>
The boy had been kept awake the night before by the
cries of “Morgana!” Confounding reality with legend,
he had resolved to go to the yacht which was in the bay;
and there he would see once more that beautiful maiden
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_460' name='Page_460' href='#Page_460'>460</a></span>
whom Phil had painted. He came down to the foot of
the castle, and loosened the boat from the old ring in the
wall to which it was fastened. Alone he set out to the
open sea. They had seen him too late; the current had
seized the boat, and the little duke was lost!
</p>

<p>
Just then a violent shock capsized the boat on a rock
almost level with the surface and threw the child into
the water. As he disappeared beneath the foam he lifted
his arms to heaven with a supreme appeal: “St. Morgana,
save me!”
</p>

<p>
“Adalbert, Monseigneur Adalbert!” cried Helia, recognizing
him, “fear nothing, I am here!”
</p>

<p>
It was the affair of a moment, and with a daring dive,
in which she risked dashing herself against a rock, Helia
grasped the boy beneath the waves and brought him
back, fainting, to the light of day.
</p>

<p>
“What anxiety they must be having on shore!”
thought Helia. “What must be the duke’s despair!
They must think the child is drowned, that there is no
possible remedy; perhaps there is not a single boat in
the port! Now, then, Helia, courage! You’ve done
harder things than this in your life. Into the sea and
take back monseigneur!”
</p>

<p>
Helia was standing on the rock, with the boy in her
arms. At a glance, she saw that the water of the different
currents was colored differently. That which
came from the shore was muddy and yellow with sand;
that from the deep sea was dark green. Into this, without
hesitation, Helia threw herself, holding Adalbert on
one arm, and swimming with the other, in superb effort.
</p>

<p>
As soon as she had turned the cliff, she saw the crowd
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_461' name='Page_461' href='#Page_461'>461</a></span>
on the shore, close to the water, very far away. They,
too, now saw her, for a great cry reached her ear. It
strengthened and comforted her.
</p>

<p>
She was crossing an eddy full of seaweed torn away
by the currents, from which she could issue with difficulty.
If the boy had come to himself, they would both
have been lost. Luckily, he remained inert, with his head
on Helia’s shoulder. Slowly she disengaged herself and
kept on her way toward the shore.
</p>

<p>
Now there was a deep silence. She could see the multitude
nearer. She could distinguish details—women
praying on their knees, and groups crowding toward
the sea. They ought to come out to her, instead of remaining
there motionless! But everybody seemed struck
powerless by amazement. The setting sun behind her
was doubtless dazzling their eyes, for a strange glow,
all red and gold, lighted up the city. Weariness overwhelmed
her,—could she ever reach the shore? The
child’s weight exhausted Helia. Truly, the people must
be stupid not to come out to her. Could no one see that
she was tired—that all her strength had been taken—that
she could do no more?
</p>

<p>
Soon she felt the sand beneath her feet. She was still
far from the shore, but the beach sank away very slowly,
and, half walking and half swimming, she kept advancing.
Now it was easier for her; the water was only
breast-high. She advanced steadily, lifting Adalbert
in her arms as if to say: “He is saved! Here he is!
Come and take him!”
</p>

<p>
But while she kept on advancing, no one came toward
her.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_462' name='Page_462' href='#Page_462'>462</a></span>
</p>

<p>
“What is the matter with them?” thought Helia.
“They do not stir—they are recoiling even, as I go toward
them. What is it frightens them so?”
</p>

<p>
Instinctively, Helia turned her head. She saw only
the waste sea and the great marvelous sky, with its
depths of purple and gold, and immense crimson cloud
forming an arch above her.
</p>

<p>
When Helia first appeared, the people had given a
great cry, and then there was silence. A thrill ran
through the multitude. “Who is coming thus from the
open sea? What wonderful being have our cries of
terror awakened?”
</p>

<p>
They saw the superb maiden issuing from the waves
and bringing back in her arms the little Duke Adalbert,
Morgania’s hope. What if it were she—Morgana!—bringing
back fortune and the future? Would it not be
the complete accomplishing of the prophecy at the date
announced and foretold?
</p>

<p>
Helia was moved at the terrified aspect of the people,
with their mute faces fixed upon her, with their ecstatic
eyes. The crowd drew aside at her approach, and a
great empty circle opened wide around her.
</p>

<p>
Helia stopped. The water reached her knees. At
this spot the sea was as placid as a lake, and the beach
was as smooth as a floor. Only two or three moss-grown
rocks lifted their heads above the water. Helia would
have shown herself in a maillot unhesitatingly before
a million men, but she was greatly embarrassed where
she was, half naked, and with her wet costume clinging
to her body.
</p>

<p>
Seeing that no one came to her assistance, she placed
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_463' name='Page_463' href='#Page_463'>463</a></span>
the little duke gently on the mossy rock and took her
resolution. She would return to the yacht by the current
leading out to sea. She was again fit and rested
by her walk over the sands. Moreover, rid of the child’s
weight, it would be no more than play for her.
</p>

<p>
Helia, with her eyes fixed on the crowd, pointed to the
child with her hand, and retired slowly backward.
When the water reached her waist she swam out vigorously
toward the yacht. The dazzling sun still kindled
the sea, flooding everything with its flames of crimson.
They could not see her from the shore in such a rush of
splendor from heaven; and while she went on and on,
just as the sun was sinking below the horizon, an immense
clamor came out to her, magnified by the echoes,
like mysterious voices issuing from plains and mountains.
</p>

<p>
It was the people on the shore acclaiming Morgana!
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_464' name='Page_464' href='#Page_464'>464</a></span>

<h3>
CHAPTER IX
<br />
STRICKEN IN TRIUMPH
</h3>

<p>
Helia was far away, swimming toward the yacht,
before the duke came down from the castle
where he was presiding at the reception of the
notables. At the time when the child was carried away by
the current no one dared tell the duke the terrible news;
but now the cries of enthusiasm grew and grew. Adalbert
was saved! When the father clasped his child in his
arms upon the beach, he all but fainted with joy.
</p>

<p>
Adalbert, coming out of his swoon, kissed his father,
and looked around him to find some one. The people
cried: “Miracle!” As for the duke, he did not see
where the miracle was. Only Miss Rowrer, so he
thought, could have had the pluck to do yesterday’s
deed at the Drina; and she alone would be capable of
taking the bay for her bath-tub, as the delegates had
told him. No doubt she had been on some rock near the
place where Adalbert’s boat had capsized.
</p>

<p>
What means had he for acknowledging the immense
service she had now rendered him? It was a unique
occasion, and the duke resolved to grasp it for expressing
his gratitude to Miss Rowrer. Listening to his heart,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_465' name='Page_465' href='#Page_465'>465</a></span>
rather than to his reason, he bound himself by oaths to
do so in presence of his people.
</p>

<p>
“I know not who it is that yesterday saved hundreds
of my subjects; I know not who it is that but now has
saved my son. Never has a duchess done so much for
our country. We might think it was Morgana herself,
whom our legends have announced. Please God she may
be free and may deign to accept my hand and share my
throne. We have need of so valiant a duchess!”
</p>

<p>
The notables took up the acclaim: “Long live the duchess!
Long live Morgana!”
</p>

<p>
The people continued thronging the beach, waiting
for the coming of the “duchess,” as they already called
her, and talking over the words of the duke, who in a
moment’s time had won back his popularity.
</p>

<p>
When their first emotion had passed, this rude populace
understood full well that Morgana and the beautiful
heroine of the Drina must be one of the foreigners
come lately from beyond the seas in the white ship.
They repeated over to each other how much the country
already owed her. Legends began to form about her.
They spoke of a coming distribution of food and clothing
to the crowd of refugees. One might have thought
she had come expressly to fulfil the people’s desire and
stir them with new hope. The duke saw all this enthusiasm
for the “foreign lady” running onward like a
flame; and his heart swelled with joy. A whole people
would express his love and speak for him, crying from
the depths of their hearts: “We love you! Be our
duchess!”
</p>

<p>
And he, the duke, as he had sworn in presence of his
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_466' name='Page_466' href='#Page_466'>466</a></span>
assembled people, would say to Miss Rowrer: “You have
saved my country and my son: will you not stay in Morgania,
to be the pride and the happiness of my house?”
</p>

<p>
The events upon the Drina, and that mysterious sympathy
which grows in popular crises, had shaken the
whole country. The prophecies of the sorceress had
been realized point by point. Even in the remotest
mountains the shepherds spoke among themselves of this
woman, so young and beautiful, who was invulnerable,
and whose heroism had repulsed the enemy. The villages
were excited; and men reached the city with their
rifles on their shoulders. Everywhere, it was one long
acclamation for Morgana. The peddlers of pious pictures
went here and there with icons in their mules’
harness and singing in her honor heroic <i>prismés</i>. As if
every one were waiting for coming events, the mountain
tracks and paths across the plain were filled on every
side with an enthusiastic crowd.
</p>

<p>
That very evening the duke was to receive the “duchess”
amid his people’s acclaim. Great bonfires were to
be lighted on the mountain-peaks at the moment of her
disembarking, and from one mountain to the other,
by signal from the city, the flames should announce her
coming. The sorceress, in the depths of her grotto,
should see at her feet the night flaming up like the dawn.
</p>

<p class="caption">“The peddler of pious pictures”</p>
</div>

<p>
On the beach, where Morgana had brought the fainting
boy, they built up hastily a rough landing-place.
They wished her coming to be at the very spot where she
had appeared in her glory; and they strewed leaves and
flowers along the way which she should follow to the
Hall of Ancestors. Never had so violent and sudden
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_467' name='Page_467' href='#Page_467'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_468' name='Page_468' href='#Page_468'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_469' name='Page_469' href='#Page_469'>469</a></span>
a movement upset Morgania. The acclaim which would
salute the “Lady” would be irresistible. It would
issue from the whole people; and the duke, swept on
by a current stronger than himself, would only have to
let events find a way for themselves.
</p>

<p>
Everybody was stirred, even Caracal, who was in the
company of the duke, when a cannon-shot, as had been
agreed, announced from the castle the arrival of the boat
bringing the “duchess.” The crowd stood in rows on
each side of the way. The duke, at the head of the body
of notables, stood alone.
</p>

<p>
Behind him the voivodes, in their glittering costume,
formed their lines, belted for war and sword in hand.
</p>

<p>
After the duke’s words of welcome, the heroic maiden
was to pass beneath an archway of these swords crossed
above her, like Maria Theresa between her Magyars;
and, as she issued from beneath their deadly glitter,
joyous hymns would break forth, and little children
strew flowers before her as a symbol of days of happiness
after days of battle. Then would begin the triumphal
march toward the Hall of the Throne.
</p>

<p>
All hearts were beating, for now they could perceive
the boat coming toward them. Caracal fixed his monocle,
like the powerful and subtle observer that he was,
and made ready to note everything.
</p>

<p>
Religious silence took the place of the tumult of voices.
They could see distinctly in the boat two young women
holding each other by the hand. Each of them was
dressed with great simplicity: it was Helia and Ethel.
The light of the torches flashed vividly upon them. They
seemed to rise out of the night; and when the sailors
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_470' name='Page_470' href='#Page_470'>470</a></span>
lifted their oars to disembark them on the landing where
the duke was waiting, there was not a gesture, not a cry.
The people heeded only them. No attention was given to
the two personages following them, a young girl and a
young man—Suzanne and Phil.
</p>

<p>
The duke bowed low before Ethel, taking her hand
with an impassioned and reverent gesture. Then he
spoke. Those who were near him could hear his voice
tremble.
</p>

<p>
“How am I to thank you, Miss Rowrer, you who have
saved my son! Morgania also owes you everything;
without you I know the villayets of Albania would have
arisen. Everything was ready to crush us! But the
defeat of the enemy, exaggerated from mouth to mouth,
has taken on proportions of a disaster! You have done
what, before you, my ancestresses, Thilda, Rhodaïs, and
Bertha, did; and like Morgana herself you have brought
back in your arms the luck of Morgania, my son Adalbert!
Behold all this people: for them you are she
whom our legends of a thousand years announce! Miss
Rowrer, I owe you everything; my whole life will not
be sufficient for the acknowledgment of your services!”
</p>

<p>
“Monseigneur,” interrupted Ethel, in a grave voice,
“the heroine, the valiant woman, she who expected no
recompense, who knew the danger and coolly faced it,
she whom your legends announce, and who has saved
your people and your child: it is not I—it is Helia!”
</p>

<p>
And taking Helia by the hand, Miss Rowrer made her
pass in front of her, while she herself stood modestly
back.
</p>

<p>
“Ah!” gasped the duke.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_471' name='Page_471' href='#Page_471'>471</a></span>
</p>

<p>
There was a little of everything in his “Ah!” A
man falling from a balloon must utter such an “Ah!”
when he crashes against the ground.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, twice the cheers burst forth. Hymns of
welcome were intoned, for silence had been kept till then.
The duke had appeared to be addressing himself to both
the young girls. The people did not know exactly which
one might be the duchess; but their enthusiasm knew
no bounds all the same. A great eddy pushed the crowd
in a mass along the way to the castle, amid the blare of
trumpets and rattling of rifle-shots. The voivodes
formed the archway of steel above the heads of the
duke and Helia, followed by Ethel. Endless cheering
saluted them: “Long live the duke! Long live the duchess!
Long live Morgana!”
</p>

<p>
“Well!” thought Caracal, “this is getting to be amusing.
I had thought all my chances lost, but they are
coming back. Miss Ethel is still free! Helia a duchess!
Well, stranger things have been seen; but all the same
it is funny. After my ‘House of Glass’ and ‘Worms
from a Dung-hill’ I shall study from nature a ducal
marriage and make it a <i>roman à clef</i>! I shall write up
every class of society—bourgeois, peasants, and princes!
He certainly will marry her: you can’t trifle with an
oath among such a population of fools; there are currents
you can’t stem.”
</p>

<p>
And so Caracal shouted louder than the others: “Long
live Morgana! Long live the duchess!” Then he offered
his arm to Miss Rowrer, who refused it!
</p>

<p>
“What are they crying ‘Long live the duchess!’ for?”
she asked Caracal, as they issued from beneath the steel
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_472' name='Page_472' href='#Page_472'>472</a></span>
arch, surrounded by children who wafted kisses toward
them and bombarded them with flowers. Caracal recounted
the oath which had been taken in presence of
the people, and before God. The duke had sworn to
offer the heroine his titles and his throne.
</p>

<p>
“Poor duke!” thought Ethel; “he really believed it
was I—otherwise he would have sworn to nothing. Well,
let it be so! We shall see if an oath is a sacred thing,
or if women are only dolls for amusement. We shall
see if the duke is a man!”
</p>

<p>
Ethel now knew the whole story. On the yacht, that
very evening, she had chanced to hear Helia talking
with Suzanne. Their few words had been a revelation
to her. She had already imagined what now she knew.
The cow painting in the Luxembourg, the whole little
combination invented by Caracal, all the coarse horse-play—ah!
if Phil thought she was going to think less
of him because of it, how mistaken he was! All that
was about as important to her as Mr. Charley’s hair,
brushed like a horse’s mane, and his velvet trousers—less
than nothing at all! But Phil had other reasons
to blush for himself, indeed. She understood
his embarrassed air when he spoke of Helia. That
he should promise marriage with an oath, should give
hopes of happiness to Helia and lift her above her
position, and then thrust her back into her hard life—that
Phil, a Christian and an American, should do a
thing like that! Ethel also knew the duke’s love-making
to Helia. Poor Helia! simply a plaything for those
two men!
</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<img src="images/i-487.png" width="392" height="550" alt="" />
<p class="caption">“The duke stood alone”</p>
</div>

<p>
She looked with admiration at the splendid couple
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_473' name='Page_473' href='#Page_473'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_474' name='Page_474' href='#Page_474'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_475' name='Page_475' href='#Page_475'>475</a></span>
before her,—the duke and Helia,—without a glance at
the two men beside her—Phil and Caracal.
</p>

<p>
Helia was superb. The red lights, shaken by the
wind, illuminated her. The popular enthusiasm was
beyond description; the crowd pressed forward behind
the torch-bearers along the way. They touched her
garments like the relics of a saint. The women lifted up
their children to make them see Morgana. Young girls
sang in chorus, while young men twirled their sabers
aloft in warlike rhythm.
</p>

<p>
All at once, above the crowd, far away in the mountains
flames arose; the bonfires blazed up on each side
of the bay and over the cliffs. An immense blaze, like
a giant torch, threw great shadows and blinding streaks
of light over the city. Its glow appeared through the
night, leaping over space from peak to peak, to the far
horizon, where it mingled with the stars.
</p>

<p>
Helia and Ethel were amazed at the grandeur of the
sight, and at the loving ardor of the crowd, in whose
eyes, too, the flame seemed burning. Their own beauty
struck everybody; surely the new duchess would be the
most popular that Morgania had ever known, to judge
from the delirious enthusiasm let loose by her presence.
</p>

<p>
“What has taken hold of them?” thought Helia.
“One might say I had done something extraordinary.”
</p>

<p>
Helia for a moment was separated from Ethel. Beyond
them the way, lonely and bare, mounted up to the
castle. Guards watched over the approach. High above
them the stained-glass window of Morgana reflected
glitteringly the torches and bonfires. In a few steps
more Helia, on the duke’s arm, would leave the people
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_476' name='Page_476' href='#Page_476'>476</a></span>
behind her and mount up, followed by the nobles, to
the Hall of Ancestors.
</p>

<p>
But just then there was a great rush forward, and
as Helia, in real fright at this wild enthusiasm, pressed
against the duke, she felt a sharp pain between her
shoulders. She gave a little cry, and struggled toward
the open space before her; but her breath failed and she
fell.
</p>

<p>
“Oh, the coward!” she murmured. “He would never
have dared strike me to my face!”
</p>

<p>
“What is the matter?” the duke said, grasping her in
his arms, “you are bleeding!”
</p>

<p>
“Oh! what has happened?” asked Ethel, who came
up at this moment, followed by Suzanne. “Helia! what
has happened to you?”
</p>

<p>
“He has killed me!” said Helia.
</p>

<p>
“It is he who has done it!” cried Suzanne, with a
terrible look, searching for some one in the crowd.
</p>

<p>
“He—who?”
</p>

<p>
“Socrate!”
</p>

<p>
It was indeed Socrate. But he was no longer there.
He had already disappeared into the shadow, seized by
avenging hands, mangled by a people’s fury, trampled
under foot into blood and mud!
</p>

<p>
Helia had guessed rightly. Socrate had come on
board the <i>Columbia</i> at Marseilles, where they had hastily
taken on firemen. Under the exasperation of want, he
took this occasion to follow Helia. He had learned as
he prowled around the circus that she was going to
Morgania on Miss Rowrer’s yacht, and he was not the
man to let go his prey.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_477' name='Page_477' href='#Page_477'>477</a></span>
</p>

<p>
The events of the last day above all else had stirred
him to fury. Helia a duchess! Helia in grandeur, while
he, the misunderstood genius, should drag out his life in
an attic! Ah! you will not be mine? Then you shall
be no one’s! He had seized the occasion and planted
his knife between Helia’s shoulders.
</p>

<p>
“Helia!” sobbed Suzanne. “Do you hear me? Answer!”
</p>

<p>
But Helia did not. The duke and Phil, terrified, bore
her to the throne-room. The torches cast a tragic light
upon the group. Immense shadows lengthened themselves
out before them. The duke and Phil, bearing
Helia, slowly advanced. The hall opened high before
them, lighted dimly.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_478' name='Page_478' href='#Page_478'>478</a></span>
</p>

</div>
<div class="chapter">

<h3>
CHAPTER X
<br />
“ON YOUR KNEES!”
</h3>

<p>
They laid Helia down at the foot of Phil’s picture,
on the great ancestral throne on which the duke
had hoped to seat himself beside Miss Rowrer.
The iron candelabrum, hanging from the arch, lighted the
hall. But Morgana’s stained window, more than all the
rest, blazed with sanguinary flashes. This time it was
not the sunset, as the duke had described it to Miss Rowrer,
when he showed her the engraving in Paris; it was
the light of torches and of the giant bonfire shining
through it from without. The heroic statues, Thilda,
Rhodaïs the Slave, and Bertha the Horsewoman, seemed
to live again beneath the glow. The flashes of light
from the window seemed to make them palpitate. One
would have said that joy swelled their marble breasts
when Helia, whose bodice had been undone, and whose
wounds were bandaged, opened her eyes and breathed
freely as she asked: “Where am I?”
</p>

<p>
“Oh, what a fright you’ve given us!” said Suzanne;
“but now you’re saved. Do you suffer?”
</p>

<p>
Helia was not suffering. To die was nothing,—but to
fall, struck from behind by such a man!
</p>

<p>
“If you had been there, Phil,” Helia said, speaking
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_479' name='Page_479' href='#Page_479'>479</a></span>
low, “you would have protected me, would you not?
Oh, with you I should fear nothing. Give me your hand
and stay with me!”
</p>

<p>
Phil, with downcast eyes full of tears, took her hand.
</p>

<p>
“Look me in the face; why do you lower your eyes,
Phil?” she said, so that he alone could hear her. She
added, with an indescribable regret in her voice: “Have
I ever reproached you? Look me in the face, as in the
old days! I wish you to be happy. I do not wish you to
be sad!”
</p>

<p>
From the city came a confused murmur, like the noise
of the sea; and then there were long moments of silence.
The nobles had not dared to enter the hall. The people’s
deep anxiety was making itself felt. Suzanne, meanwhile,
was arranging the cushions under Helia’s head.
The duke had gone a little away.
</p>

<p>
“Yes,” he was saying to himself, “Miss Rowrer will
understand the sacrifice I am making for her. I fail in
my word, it is true, but she will be grateful to me for
not having made Helia her rival. As to the people, Miss
Rowrer’s millions will make them forget my perjury.”
</p>

<p>
Ethel, with Caracal at her elbow, gave to a servant the
basin of water and bloody cloths. Impassive as the marble
ancestresses, she turned her clear eyes on Phil and
the duke.
</p>

<p>
“Phil,” Helia continued, as she pressed his hand,
“you promised me once—do you remember?—when you
loved me, in the old days? I understand, many things
have passed since; and you are no longer the same man.
Come here, Phil, nearer, nearer! I want to tell a secret
in your ear. I have loved only you, Phil; every day
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_480' name='Page_480' href='#Page_480'>480</a></span>
I have waited for you, and you never came! I was mad,
I know; it was impossible! But when one is young one
is ignorant—and I believed you! Now you love another.
Phil, I forgive you; but leave your hand in
mine.”
</p>

<p>
Phil was silent and red with shame. Ah, indeed, he
remembered! Helia felt his heart beating in the hand
which pressed her own. An intense emotion overpowered
him. He had the fearful calm which goes before
a storm. Neither the duke nor Phil spoke, motionless,
by the side of Helia, who was resting tranquilly,
while they made a room ready for her.
</p>

<p>
“You can get up and go to it by yourself,” said Suzanne.
“You’re safe. You haven’t lost much blood—Socrate’s
blow missed!”
</p>

<p>
“What!” murmured Ethel. “Our heroic Helia is
going to die in the presence of these two men who loved
her, without one of them asking her pardon for their
false oaths?”
</p>

<p>
“They accuse me of being cynical, but I should be more
loyal than that,” said Caracal, with his gaze fixed on
Ethel.
</p>

<p>
“Look at your work, M. Caracal,” Ethel replied,
in a low tone of contempt. “Those two men are
your pupils. The duke, who will not see that the fortune
of nations is courage and respect for promises—and Phil,
whom I thought more noble,—look at him,
blushing with shame, lowering his eyes,—these are the
men according to your heart! They are the men who consider
woman a plaything, and abandon her when she
ceases to please! I forgive you your Richard the Lion-hearted,
your blackmailing, and your infamies, but look
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_481' name='Page_481' href='#Page_481'>481</a></span>
at the result of your bad example and ignoble theories!
When you threw Helia at Socrate that you might study
passion cheaply, without knowing it you put the dagger
in the assassin’s hand. Helia struck down from behind,—it
is your work! The duke, forgetful of duty and aiming
at Helia for his mistress, it is your work! Phil, with
his false promises, is worthy of you! Two men spoiled,
one assassin, and a dying woman—look at your work,
M. Caracal!”
</p>

<p>
The “subtle observer,” a poor human rag blown down
by a breath, collapsed into a chair.
</p>

<p>
The great window still threw its burning glow upon
the throne. The marble ancestors, dimly lighted, seemed
to lift their heads to curse the feeble duke. They
formed a circle round the hall and the throne where
Helia was resting—Helia, brave as Rhodaïs, intrepid as
Thilda, invulnerable as Bertha—Helia, the Morgana
announced and foretold. The duke was pale and grave.
He looked at Helia, and then turned his head toward
Ethel.
</p>

<p>
All at once Ethel saw Helia rise upon her elbow, with
one hand convulsively grasping that of Phil, and the
other signing to listen. Through the half-open door
floated a far-away melody, so weak, so far away—Phil
felt its thrill in his heart.
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>Le roi fait battre le tambour</p>
<p>Pour appeler ses dames,</p>
<p>Et la première qu’il a vue</p>
<p>Lui a ravi son âme.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p>The king had the drum beat</p>
<p>To call out his ladies—</p>
<p>And the first one he sees</p>
<p>Steals away his soul.</p>
</div></div></div>
<p>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_482' name='Page_482' href='#Page_482'>482</a></span>
</p>

<p>
It seemed to come with the sea-breeze from beyond
the murmurs of the land. It was the music of the yacht
playing the air chosen by Ethel, that air which Helia
hummed when she was alone. Ethel had foreseen the
hour when Helia would be entering the throne-room.
The music from the yacht was to greet her triumph.
Now it seemed to be soothing her agony.
</p>

<p>
“Listen, Phil, listen!” said Helia; “do you remember?”
</p>

<p>
Phil remembered all and saw all once more—his first
love, the little Saint John, the Louvre paradise, all his
promises! His youth blossomed in his heart.
</p>

<p>
In his breast rose a flame which burned away every
selfish thought. Yes, he had promised! Helia had lived
in that only hope; he had let her fall from the height
of her dream! He had shut off the future from her.
He had dug a pit with his selfishness, and pushed Helia
into it when she ceased to please! He had turned his
back on her despair!
</p>

<p>
It seemed to him that a giant hand was bending him
low before Helia and a voice was saying: “Down on
your knees!”
</p>

<p>
Quickly, quickly and low, as one might confess a
crime, Phil spoke:
</p>

<p>
“Yes, I was wrong—yes, I promised. I ask pardon,
Helia! How I shall thank God if he will let you live,
that I may blot out my fault!”
</p>

<p>
“Oh, Phil!” murmured Helia.
</p>

<p>
“I love you still,” said Phil; “and you shall be my
wife. You will see how happy we shall be—Helia, forgive
me!”
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_483' name='Page_483' href='#Page_483'>483</a></span>

</p>

<p>
“Let me kiss your lips!” said Helia.
</p>

<p>
Ethel had drawn near, followed by Caracal. There
was a strange light in her eyes.
</p>

<p>
“See,” she said to Caracal. “Glory to those who are
struck down by the light like St. Paul. There is joy
in heaven for the repenting sinner!”
</p>

<p>
“Will you ever pardon me?” stammered Caracal.
</p>

<p>
“Perhaps; tears wash away many things,” added
Ethel, remembering how Phil had already pardoned
Caracal because he had seen him weeping.
</p>

<p>
“That is a man worth loving, a rare thing,” Ethel
thought as she looked at Phil. Helia now was sitting up;
the wound no longer bled.
</p>

<p>
“How happy I am!” said Helia.
</p>

<p>
She wept with joy. Phil was at her knees as in the
old days. “Listen,” she said, “it is our tune of the
old times, Phil! I seem still to be there!”
</p>

<p>
Phil kissed her hands to hide his tears.
</p>

<p>
“Phil,” said Helia, with a timid look at Ethel, and in
a tone so low that it could come only from the heart,
“tell me, Phil, am I really fit to be your wife?”
</p>

<p>
The door opened slowly, a bright light burst into the
hall. It was the voivodes coming for information. If
a misfortune had happened to one of the maidens, perhaps
to their duchess, when they were on the spot, sword
in hand to form a sheltering arch above her—what a
shame it would be for them! If the duchess was dying,
they would pray for her on their knees. They approached
in silence. The duke had drawn near Ethel.
</p>

<p>
“I love you!” he said, speaking low. “See what I
have done for you! I swore—but I thought it was you.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_486' name='Page_486' href='#Page_486'>486</a></span>
There is still time. My people await their duchess.
Shall it be you, Miss Rowrer?”
</p>

<p>
The duke held out his hand in an attitude of deepest
respect.
</p>

<p>
Miss Rowrer stopped him short with a gesture. She
had judged the two men. This ruler who would not keep
his oath, sworn in the name of his ancestors—he should
never be husband of hers. To her titles were nothing,
character was all. Calm as Justice, with her eyes fixed
straight on the duke, she pointed with her hand to Phil,
kneeling beside Helia, and said:
</p>

<p>
“That is a Man!”

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
